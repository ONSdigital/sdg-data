Bioenergy - renewable energy made from material of recent biological origin derived from plant or animal matter, known as biomass. AD - Anaerobic Digestion  is a natural process in which microorganisms break down organic matter, in the absence of oxygen, into biogas (a mixture of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane) and digestate (a nitrogen-rich fertiliser). The biogas can be used directlyin engines for Combined Heat and Power (CHP), burned to produce heat, or can be cleaned and used in the same way as natural gas or as a vehicle fuel.","available_disaggregations":"Region; Renewable Source","computation_calculations":"Type of Energy (in Watts)/Population","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"1.
