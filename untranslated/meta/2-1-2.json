The questions used are based on a suite of food security questions developed by the <a href='https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the- us/survey-tools/#household'>US Department of Agriculture (USDA)</a>. Questions are asked of the \u2018last 30 days'. This is an important difference to the UN metadata and other UK measures of food insecurity, which use questions based on \u2018the last 12 months\u2019. The question set is presented in table 9.10 of the source data.","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=2&Target=2.1","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 2.1","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","computation_definitions":"<p>Low food security - The household reduced the quality, variety, and desirability of their diets, but the quantity of food intake and normal eating patterns were not substantially disrupted.</p><p>Very low food security - At times during the last 30 days, eating patterns of one or more household members were disrupted and food intake reduced because the household lacked money and other resources for food.</p><p>Household - One person living alone or a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address. These people share cooking facilities and share a living room, sitting room, or dining area, but it is clear who the head of the household is.</p><p>Households being shared on an equal basis are not included. For example, a house shared by a group of professionals is not included. However, households where adult children are living with their parents or where there are lodgers, but the owner lives in the household are included.</p><p>Head of household - The sole householder (i.e. the person who owns or rents the accommodation). Or if there are multiple householders, the person with the highest personal income from all sources. Or if multiple householders have the same income, the eldest.</p><p>Disability Status - The <a href='https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/measuring-disability-for-the-equality-act-2010'>(GSS) harmonised \"core\" definition</a> identifies a person as disabled if they have a physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more. It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day- to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p><p>State Pension age - From 6 April 2010, the State Pension age has been increasing gradually for women, and since December 2018 has been increasing for both men and women. These data for 2019/20  were collected throughout the financial year 2019-20, during which the State Pension age for both men and women increased from 65 years 2 months to 65 years 8 months.</p><p>Highest qualification - Educational attainment is measured by the highest level of qualification achieved. England, Wales and Northern Ireland use a range from Entry Level to Level 8. Scottish qualifications use a range from 1 to 12, but have been converted to the England, Wales and Northern Ireland system using an <a href='https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/64561.html'>equivalency chart</a>. Entry level includes qualifications such as Entry Level Awards and Entry Level Functional Skills.  Level 1 includes qualifications such as GCSEs (grades 1-3/G-D) and Scottish National 4 qualifications. Level 2 includes qualifications such as GCSEs (grade 4/C and above) and Scottish National 5 qualifications. Level 3  includes qualifications such as A levels and Scottish Highers. Level 4 or higher covers a range of further education and university qualifications, including undergraduate degrees (such as BA, BSc, LLB), Master's degrees, doctoral qualifications (such as PhDs), most professional medical qualifications and PGCEs. No reported qualifications covers qualifications where the exact type or level could not be established during the interview.</p><p>Ethnic group - Sample sizes for 'Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller' are small, so for Northern Ireland, 'Irish Traveller' is included in 'Other ethnic group'. For England, Wales and Scotland, 'Gypsy or Irish Traveller' is included in 'White'. It is not possible to disaggregate Mixed/multiple ethnic group due to differences in data collection of the country specific questions.
