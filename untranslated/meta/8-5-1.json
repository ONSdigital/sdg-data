Earnings exclude employers\u2019 contributions in respect of their employees paid to social security and pension schemes and also the benefits received by employees under these schemes. Earnings also exclude severance and termination pay. For international comparability purposes, statistics of earnings used relate to employees\u2019 gross remuneration, i.e. the total before any deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and other obligations of employees. As stated in the indicator title, data on earnings should be presented on the basis of the arithmetic average of the hourly earnings of all employees. </p><p>Disability Status - The <a href=\"https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/measuring-disability-for-the-equality-act-2010/\">(GSS) harmonised \"core\" definition</a> identifies a person as disabled if they have a physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more. It must reduce  their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce/limit their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>","available_disaggregations":"<p>Headlines figures are provided by ASHE except by disability status and disability status by sex which are from the APS.</p><p> Disability pay gaps analysis can be found <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/disability/articles/disabilitypaygapsintheuk/2021\">here</a></p><p>Further disaggregation by ethnicity are available from <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/ethnicitypaygapreferencetables\">Ethnicity facts and figures</a>.
