Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a society, serving the government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation.

Specificlly, under Principle 9 statistical legislation require the alignment of methods and classifications with international standards. The Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 does not refer to applying international standards, but calls on the Board (the UKSA) to develop and maintain definitions, methodologies, classifications and standards for official statistics. In relation to UN Principle 10, the UK statistical legislation does not require the engagements in bilateral and multilateral cooperation in statistics. However, under the Value piller, the Code of Practice does encourage producers of official statistics to collaborate and share knowledge - within the UK and internationally.</p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.

To meet the requirements of this indicator, a country must fulfil all the ten principles adopted by the UN Statistical Commission in its 1994 Special Session (see 'Definitions' section). Here we outline the relevant UK policies, according to which the UK can be classed as *partially* compliant with the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. See 'Other information' section for more detail.</p><p>The fulfilment of the ten Fundamental Principles in the UK relates directly to the work of the <a href=\"https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/what-we-do/\">UK Statistics Authority (UKSA)</a>, and its regulatory arm, the <a href=\"https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/osr/\">Office for Statistics Regulation</a>. All producers of official statistics in the UK must adhere to the <a href=\"https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/\">UKSA Code of Practice</a>. The framework for the Code of Practice is based on three pillars \u2013 Trustworthiness, Quality and Value. Each pillar contains a number of principles and detailed practices that producers should commit to when producing and releasing official statistics. All of this is underpinned by legislation in the  <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/18/contents\">Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007</a>.</p>\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-06-13","national_data_updated_date":"2019-04-29","target_number":"17.18","goal_number":"17","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"global_indicators.17-18-2-title"}
