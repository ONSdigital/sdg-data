This is the difference between output and intermediate consumption for any given industry/sector. This means the difference between the value of goods and services produced (output) and the cost of raw materials and other inputs which are used up in production (intermediate consumption). Data are in constant prices with 2016 defined as the base year.","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Energy Agency (IEA), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=9&Target=9.4","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 9.4","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Thousand Tonnes per Million GBP (\u00a3)","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"2017 Carbon Dioxide emissions data are provisional","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"CO2 emissions intensity by industry","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"GDP","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":1997,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/carbondioxideemissionsintensitybyindustry","source_url_text_1":"Carbon dioxide emissions intensity by industry","source_release_date_1":"05/02/2019","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"environment.accounts@ons.gov.uk","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"09-04-01","other_info":"All emissions intensity figures exclude consumer expenditure.
