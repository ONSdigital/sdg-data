Of particular note were</p><p> - the pausing of the Great Britain Tourism Survey (GBTS) in periods of 2020. This, in combination with a merging of the GBTS with Great Britain Day Visits Survey (GBDVS), has resulted in Visit Britain not publishing domestic tourism statistics from these sources for the period January 2020 to March 2021.</p><p> - the pausing of the International Passenger Survey (IPS) from 16 March 2020, meaning that no IPS data on spending on international visits between the UK and the rest of the world were available for quarters 2 to 4 2020. The IPS data are a major input to the UK-TSA.</p><p> - no data from the Northern Ireland Continuous Household Survey were available for 2020.</p><p>These interferences created substantial challenges to production of the UK-TSA for 2020, most notably a need to use alternative data sources. This has resulted in</p><p> - a reduction in the direct-relevance of data inputs, meaning that the estimates in the UK-TSA 2020 are subject to more uncertainty than usual, impacting all data tables in the UK-TSA output.</p><p> - a discontinuity in UK-TSA estimates, due to having to utilise alternative data sources and new modelling techniques.
