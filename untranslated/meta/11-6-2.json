The mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country, and is expressed in micrograms per cubic meter [\u03bcg/m3 ]. Air pollution consists of many pollutants, among other particulate matter. These particles are able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and therefore constitute a risk for health by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and selected cardiovascular diseases. Urban/rural data - while the data quality available for urban/rural population is generally good for high income countries, it can be relatively poor for some low- and middle income areas. Furthermore, the definition of urban/rural may greatly vary by country.","computation_calculations":"The annual urban mean concentration of PM2.5 is estimated with improved modelling using data integration from satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography and ground measurements (WHO, 2016a; Shaddick et al, 2016).","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter in towns and cities (population weighted)","data_show_map":true,"data_keywords":"map","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"World Health Organisation (WHO)","source_periodicity_1":"Discontinuous","source_earliest_available_1":2008,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.AMBIENTCITY2016?lang=en","source_url_text_1":"Global Health Observatory data repository","source_release_date_1":"15/05/2014","source_next_release_1":"TBC: We plan to update indicator data within 4 months of data being released","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-Official","source_contact_1":"WHO Regional Office for Europe","source_other_info_1":"Values >2013 not available - see Data Source 2","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"World Health Organisation (WHO)","source_periodicity_2":"Discontinuous","source_earliest_available_2":2013,"source_geographical_coverage_2":"United Kingdom","source_url_2":"http://www.who.int/airpollution/data/cities/en/","source_url_text_2":"WHO Global Ambient Air Quality Database (update 2018)","source_release_date_2":"01/05/2018","source_next_release_2":"TBC: We plan to update indicator data within 4 months of data being released","source_statistical_classification_2":"Non-Official","source_contact_2":"http://www.who.int/about/contacthq/en/","source_other_info_2":"Ambient (outdoor) air quality database, by country and city","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"11-06-02","other_info":"Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.
