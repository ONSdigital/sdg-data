Stunting here is defined as cases with height for age less than -2 standard deviations from the median of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth- standards\">World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards</a>. Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation of a set of values.</p><p> Index of Multiple Deprivation - the index of multiple deprivation (IMD)  is a measure of relative deprivation in England. Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in England are ranked from most deprived to least deprived and divided into 5 equal groups called quintiles. LSOAs in quintile 1 fall within the most deprived 20% of LSOAs nationally and LSOAs in quintile 5 fall within the least deprived 20% of LSOAs nationally. This variable is based on child residency post code, so entries without a post code were excluded from the analysis. As a result, the total IMD sample number does not add up to the total sample size. </p><p> Rural/urban classification - the Urban variable includes all settlements with over 10,000 population. The Rural variable includes all settlements classed as town and fringe, village, and hamlet and isolated dwellings.</p>","available_disaggregations":"Sex; Index of Multiple Deprivation; Ethnicity; Rural or Urban classification.

The analysis is only for children aged 4 years old in Reception at the time of measurement (age group 48 to 59 months old). These children would have turned 5 within the academic year. Children who had already turned 5 at the time of measurement are excluded from this analysis. <p/><p> Totals presented in this document include all children in state-maintained schools, with a valid height and weight measurement, including those with an unknown residency. Since 2008/09 over 99% of child records have a valid home postcode. <p/> <p> This analysis does not contain any measurement data which can be used to monitor the indirect impact of COVID-19 on BMI in children. The 2019-20 NCMP data collection stopped in March 2020 when schools were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a usual NCMP collection year, national participation rates are around 95% (over a million) of all eligible children, however in 2019-20 the number of children measured was around 75% of previous years. Despite the lower than usual number of measurements, analysis by NHS Digital indicates that figures at national  level are directly comparable to previous years. <p/> <p> Sample sizes are available in source data <p/> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.
