We are reporting data on births occurring within medical facilities and have not included home births. Home births will on many occasions have a skilled health professional present. There will be some home births which occur without a midwife but an ambulance is sent, arriving just before or soon after the birth.  We have included data from NHS medical facilities - (generally) hospitals, maternity units and maternity wings and non-NHS medical facilities including - private maternity units, military hospitals, private hospitals and communal establishments.  This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.
