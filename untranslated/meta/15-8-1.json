The strategy covers all non-native species of flora and fauna with the exception of genetically modified organisms, bacteria and viruses.\n\nIn our [6th National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity](http://data.jncc.gov.uk/data/527ff89f-5f6b-4e06-bde6-b823e0ddcb9a/UK-CBD-6NR-v2-web.pdf), the UK report progress against Aichi Target 9 - by 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment of invasive alien species. The assessment concluded we were making progress towards the target but at an insufficient rate.\n\nThe report stated that - Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) are managed on a Great Britain and all-Ireland basis in the British Isles, with countries working closely together to co-ordinate their efforts. Priority species have been identified following extensive scientific review and expert input and a framework to prioritise their management have been developed. Comprehensive risk analysis processes are in place (including horizon scanning, risk assessment and risk management), as are new information systems and contingency plans to support rapid response. Despite strong action, currently the number of INNS established in Britain has remained constant, in terrestrial environments, and has increased in the freshwater and marine environment.  \n\nFurther information on the UK status against treaties and Action Plans, National Reports and National Legislation relating to invasive non-native species can be found on the [InforMEA](https://www.informea.org/en/countries/GB/parties) website. Invasive non-native species are covered in a range of laws and action plans, and can be found by using the filter bar across the top of the page. \n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2020-07-03","national_data_updated_date":"2019-04-18","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-07-03: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/7141a1e8a904c110721f533c298255df0f43c841","national_data_update_url_text":"2019-04-18: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/856dc1b4c325685125dca5b072db4d48bd7e1246","indicator":"15.8.1","target_id":"15.8","sdg_goal":"15","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"global_indicators.15-8-1-title"}
