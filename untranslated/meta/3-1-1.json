The report includes confidence intervals (a measure of reliability) and analysis, including statistical significance of the data.</p><h3>Maternal mortality ratio</h3><p>Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is estimated for the UK using routinely reported data. It is included as a series here for international comparability only. The data for MMR is originally sourced from Office for National Statistics, General Register Office for Scotland, and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.</p><p>MMR is much lower (about half) than the actual rates as identified through the UK CEMD, which uses multiple sources of death identification.
