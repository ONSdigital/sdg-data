However, for January 2021 the proportion of children temporarily absent is a lot higher due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the national lockdown in the UK. For more information about methodology please see <a href=\"https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/education-provision-children-under-5-years-of-age-methodology\"> Education provision - children under 5 years of age methodology</a>.</p><p> The number of 2-year-olds eligible for government-funded early years provision is estimated using the number of households with 2-year-olds that are in receipt of income-related benefits but excludes children eligible to access the provision for other reasons. Therefore, the true number of 2-year-olds eligible is under-estimated. In turn, the take- up rate of government-funded early years provision for 2-year-olds is over-estimated.</p><p> The take-up rates for government-funded early years provision for 3 and 4-year-olds are calculated based on population estimates derived from mid-year estimates and projections produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). These population estimates do not yet take updated figures based on Census 2021 data into account. As a consequence, previous population estimates for 3 and 4-year-olds from 2013 onwards are likely overestimates to some extent, and therefore the derived take-up rates are likely underestimates. </p><p> For more information about both population estimates please see the \"About these statistics\" section within <a href=\"https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/education-provision-children-under-5\"> Education provision - children under 5 years of age</a>. </p><p> Population estimates are derived from mid-year estimates and projections produced by the ONS. Those at lower geographic levels, such as local authority, are subject to a greater degree of error. In some cases, local authority take-up rates can exceed 100%. Therefore, take-up rates at local authority level should be treated with more caution than national take-up rates.<p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
