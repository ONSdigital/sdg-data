In contrast, the data for local authority councillors are separated by country as are the devolved parliament and assembly seats of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \n\n\u2022\t Since 1918, when women were first permitted to stand as MPs, the UK has had a total of 559 different women elected to the House of Commons (as of 04/03/2022).\n\n\u2022\t Until 1997 there had never been more than 10% of seats held by women. There are currently 225 female MPs in the House of Commons.
