It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>","computation_calculations":"The indicator is calculated as the percentage of people in a given population who have responded \u2018yes\u2019 to a selected number of variables e.g. the use of ICT skills in various subject areas or learning domains, the use of ICT skills inside or outside of school and/or workplace, the minimum amount of time spend using ICT skills inside and outside of school and/or workplace, availability of internet access inside or outside of school and/or workplace, etc.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of population (aged 16 and over) who have exercised information and communication technology (ICT) skills in the previous 12 months, by type of skill","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":null,"expected_disaggregations":["Skill"],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2015,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Great Britain","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/datasets/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividualsreferencetables","source_url_text_1":"Internet access - households and individuals","source_release_date_1":"12/08/2019","source_next_release_1":"07/08/2020","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"Cecil Prescott - esociety@ons.gov.uk","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"04-04-01","other_info":"<p>The Washington Group on Disability Statistics are often used to provide a cross-nationally comparable population-based measures of disability.
