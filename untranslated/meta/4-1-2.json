However, the Department for Education (DfE) recognises the need to to continue to raise standards in English and maths. As such, the DfE class a grade 5 and above in English or maths as a \u2018strong pass' and report the percentage of pupils achieving grades 5 or above as its headline school performance measure for English and maths attainment. </p><p> In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, summer exams were cancelled in 2020. Pupils scheduled to sit GCSE and A/AS level exams in 2020 were awarded either a centre assessment grade or their calculated grade using a model developed by Ofqual. The new method of awarding grades has led to a set of pupil attainment statistics that are unlike previous years. The 2021/22 academic year saw the return of the summer exam series. As part of the transition back to the summer exam series, adaptations were made to the exams (including advance information) and the approach to grading for 2022 exams broadly reflected a midpoint between results in 2019 and 2021. Given the unprecedented change in the way GCSE results were awarded in the summers of 2020 and 2021, as well as the changes to grade boundaries and methods of assessment for 2021/22, users need to exercise caution when considering comparisons over time, as they may not reflect changes in pupil performance alone. </p><p> For more information please visit <a href=\"https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/key-stage-4-performance-revised/2021-22\">DfE KS4 2019/20. </a></p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
