The indicator only takes into account the consumption which is recorded from production, import, export, and sales data often via taxation. Numerator - The amount of recorded alcohol consumed per capita (15+ years) during a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol. Denominator - Midyear resident population (15+ years) for the same calendar year, UN World Population Prospects, medium variant.</p><p> Unrecorded APC is defined as the unrecorded amount of alcohol consumed per adult (15+ years) in litres of pure alcohol. Unrecorded consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental control, such as home or informally produced alcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol, surrogate alcohol (which is alcohol not intended for human consumption), or alcohol obtained through cross-border shopping (which is recorded in a different jurisdiction). Numerator - The amount of unrecorded alcohol consumed per adult (15+ years) during a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol.
