It is a legal requirement to register a birth in the United Kingdom within 42 days. There is no direct measure of number of children who are unregistered. As registration is comprehensive, a figure of 100% is used.\n\nInformation provided at birth registration is used to produce birth statistics, which are published separately for each of the United Kingdom countries.
