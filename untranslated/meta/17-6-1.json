The disaggregated data up to 2018 is available from Source 1 (UN Global Database) and the latest figure for the headline measure is obtained from Source 2 (ITU). <br><br> The indicator fixed Internet broadband subscriptions, by speed, refers to the number of fixed-broadband subscriptions to the public Internet, split by advertised download speed. Fixed Internet broadband subscriptions refer to subscriptions to high-speed access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This includes cable modem, DSL, fibre-to-the-home/building, other fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions, satellite broadband and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. This total is measured irrespective of the method of payment. It excludes subscriptions that have access to data communications (including the Internet) via mobile-cellular networks. It should include fixed WiMAX and any other fixed wireless technologies. It includes both residential subscriptions and subscriptions for organizations. <br> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","page_content":"","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-04-08: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/21c008c1c84ce5e372d1d935a28c630c3916a8bf","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-08: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/21c008c1c84ce5e372d1d935a28c630c3916a8bf","indicator":"17.6.1","target_id":"17.6","sdg_goal":"17","indicator_sort_order":"17-06-01","graph_title":"global_indicators.17-6-1-title"}
