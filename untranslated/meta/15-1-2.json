UK-level data can be found in the Country Profiles, with further information included on Protected Area designation types, and IUCN management categories. To view these you will need to create a log in but this is free to do. Please note that the figures we present here differ slightly, because we include an extra set of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), namely Important Plant Areas. IBAT gives the option to view individual KBAs and Protected Areas on a map - by clicking on KBAs, and then on the name of the area the user is given more information on why it is classed as a KBA, and the species present. By clicking on Protected Areas, and then on the name of the area, the user is taken to the individual area on <a href=\"https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/search-areas?geo_type=site\">Protected Planet</a>.
