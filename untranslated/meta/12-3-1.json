Current UK data is for food waste.</p> <p>Hospitality and Food Services data are a modelled result, based on changes in the number and types of hospitality and food service sites, and the assumption that food waste per site has remained constant since 2011. Currently there is not a data source to enable a UK-level estimate for food waste from this sector to be robustly estimated.</p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-04-06","national_data_updated_date":"2021-11-18","target_number":"12.3","goal_number":"12"}
