A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a  situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users.","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=6&Target=6.4","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 6.4","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","computation_definitions":"<p>Level of water stress is an estimate of pressure from all sectors on the country\u2019s renewable freshwater resources.
