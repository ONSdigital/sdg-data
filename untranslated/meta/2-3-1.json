It represents how efficiently the agricultural industry uses the resources that are available to turn inputs into outputs.","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=2&Target=2.3","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 2.3","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Index","computation_definitions":"All outputs - The volume of all outputs sold off the farm. This excludes transactions within the industry. All inputs - The volume of goods and services purchased and consumed. This excludes transactions within the industry. Total factor productivity - How efficiently all inputs are turned into outputs. Derived by dividing all outputs by all inputs. Partial productivity - How efficiently intermediate consumption, capital, labour or land is transformed into outputs. Derived by dividing all outputs by each factor.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Total Factor & Labour Productivity index (1973=100)","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"DEFRA","expected_disaggregations":["Enterprise Size"],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":1973,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"Total factor productivity of the agricultural industry","source_release_date_1":"10/05/2019","source_next_release_1":"01/11/2019","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistics","source_contact_1":"enviro.statistics@defra.gsi.gov.uk","source_active_2":false,"source_contact_2":"Forestry Commission, Silvan House, 231 Corstorphine Road, Edinb.

It measures total outputs against a part of the inputs. The chart below clearly shows that labour has to date been the key input in driving productivity gains. Productivity by labour shows a steady increase over the whole period. Labour volumes are now approximately half of what they were in 1973. However over the last few years growth in labour productivity is due to increased output rather than a reduction in labour volume.","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-01-12","national_data_updated_date":"2022-01-12","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-01-12: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/f81ce9d623c36d47fdab1b37d4c3eb61ddee79fa","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-01-12: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/f81ce9d623c36d47fdab1b37d4c3eb61ddee79fa","indicator":"2.3.1","target_id":"2.3","sdg_goal":"2"}
