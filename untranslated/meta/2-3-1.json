It represents how efficiently the agricultural industry uses the resources that are available to turn inputs into outputs.","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=2&Target=2.3","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 2.3","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Index","computation_definitions":"<p>All outputs - the volume of all outputs sold off the farm. This excludes transactions within the industry.</p> <p>All inputs - the volume of goods and services purchased and consumed. This excludes transactions within the industry.</p><p>Total factor productivity - how efficiently all inputs are turned into outputs. Derived by dividing all outputs by all inputs.</p><p>Partial productivity (part of the productivity disaggregation) - partial productivity shows the impact key inputs have on productivity. It measures total outputs against a part of the inputs and shows how efficiently productivity by intermediate consumption, capital consumption, labour or land is transformed into outputs. Derived by dividing all outputs by each factor.</p>","available_disaggregations":"Productivity, Outputs, Inputs","computation_calculations":"The only calculation performed in the data acquisition of this indicator was the rebasing of the Labour inputs index in order for appropriate comparisons to be made as appropriate data was readily available for the other dissagregations in the final format specified by this indicator. This is done by dividing each value by the 1973 value and multiplying by 100. In this way the 1973 value equals 100 and all others show change relative to 1973.
