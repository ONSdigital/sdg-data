Food production industries are defined using Standard Industrial Classification 2003 (SIC03) from 2000 to 2008 and Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC07) from 2008 onwards. SIC03 - SIC division 01 and 05 are used. SIC07 - SIC division 01 and 03 are used. Low pay is defined as the value that is two-thirds of median hourly earnings and high pay is defined as the value that is 1.5 times median hourly earnings. For example, median hourly earnings for full-time employees in 2017 is \u00a314.00, therefore low pay employees are considered to be anyone earning below two-thirds of \u00a314.00, which is \u00a39.33 and high pay full-time employees are those earning anything above 1.5 times \u00a314.00, which is \u00a321.00.
