Precious metals (particularly gold) have a high RME factor, so can have distinctive impact on the results. This is particularly true for the UK, who are responsible for more than three quarters of the EU\u2019s imports of gold. While the impact is minimal at the total level, it is more evident when looking at the material footprint of metal ores.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"material footprint, environment","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2008,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/materialfootprintintheuk","source_url_text_1":"Material Footprint in the UK","source_release_date_1":"02/04/2020","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_contact_1":"environment.accounts@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Data acquired is based on the Eurostat approach.","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"12-02-01","other_info":"The choice of method used to calculate material footprint has an impact on the final estimates. In 2017, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) consulted extensively with the University of Leeds about developing further environmentally relevant metrics for material use and resource efficiency, particularly in carbon terms. As a result, the University of Leeds have developed a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) approach, using a specifically derived UK MRIO database to underpin calculations. These estimates and further information on the Eurostat and University of Leeds approach are published in the <a href= \"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/methodologies/measuringmaterialfootprintintheuk2008to2016\">Measuring material footprint</a> report. While data is available from 2000, it is not reported here because data from 2008 onwards are not directly comparable to those in earlier years. In addition, the Eurostat method is more suitable for international comparisons. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2020-07-03","national_data_updated_date":"2021-11-22","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-07-03: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/7141a1e8a904c110721f533c298255df0f43c841","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-11-22: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/2b4e5cccc295bc9494a41ff4b6b05b7fc6848828","indicator":"12.2.1","target_id":"12.2","sdg_goal":"12"}
