In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. This indicator is based on gross ODA flows grouped under Type of Aid code E01 (Scholarships/training in donor country) CRS.

Amount extended was then summed for each SID sector and country income classification. The education sector was further broken down by SectorPurposeText variable. The indicator requires gross disbursements of ODA, so the amount extended value was used to do the sums, rather than the headline ODA value.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Gross Official Development Assistance (ODA) for scholarships","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"ODA","expected_disaggregations":["Sector","Type of study"],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2009,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-on-international-development-final-uk-aid-spend-2020","source_url_text_1":"Statistics on International Development (SID) Final UK Aid Spend 2020","source_release_date_1":"29/09/2021","source_next_release_1":"Spring 2022: We plan to update indicator data within 4 months of data being released","source_statistical_classification_1":"National statistic","source_contact_1":"statistics@fcdo.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Latest ODA flows data are obtained from table \u201cData underlying the SID publication\u201d, AmountExtended column for gross disbursements (see relevant codes in National Metadata tab).
