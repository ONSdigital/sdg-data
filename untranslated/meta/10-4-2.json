'Retired' refers to anyone living in a retired household. A retired household is one where more than 50% of its income is sourced from people who (i) define themselves as retired and are aged over 50, OR (ii) define themselves as \u201cSick/Injured\u201d, not seeking work and aged at or above the State Pension Age (SPA).","available_disaggregations":"Retirement status","computation_calculations":"Gini coefficient for original income <i> minus </i> Gini coefficient for final income. Original income includes all sources of income from employment, private pensions, investments and other non-government sources. The receipt of cash benefits is then added to original income to estimate gross income, and then direct taxes are subtracted to estimate disposable income. Indirect taxes (for example, VAT, alcohol duties and so on) are further subtracted to form post-tax income, and finally benefits-in-kind (for example, state education, National Health Service) are added to estimate final income.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"Ranked by equivalised disposable income, using the modified-OECD scale.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Redistributive impact of fiscal policy","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Income, inequality, Gini","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":1977,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/datasets/theeffectsoftaxesandbenefitsonhouseholdincomefinancialyearending2014","source_url_text_1":"Effect of Taxes and Benefits on household income","source_release_date_1":"28/05/2021","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"hie@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Although data is available from 1977 onwards, due to a change in the methodology adjusting for top earners, we only use data from 2001/2002 onwards to report against this indicator.","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"other_info":"<p>The five stages in the redistribution of income are -</p><p> stage one - household members begin with income from employment, private pensions, investments and other non-government sources; this is referred to as \"original income\"</p> <p>stage two - households then receive income from cash benefits; the sum of cash benefits and original income is referred to as \"gross income\"</p> <p>stage three - households then pay direct taxes; direct taxes, when subtracted from gross income, are referred to as \"disposable income\"</p> <p>stage four - indirect taxes are then paid via expenditure; disposable income minus indirect taxes is referred to as \"post-tax income\"</p> <p>stage five - households finally receive a benefit from services (benefits-in-kind); benefits-in-kind plus post-tax income is referred to as \"final income\"</p> <p> For more information please look at the associated  <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/theeffectsoftaxesandbenefitsonhouseholdincome/financialyearending2020\"> publciation </a> and  <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/methodologies/theeffectsoftaxesandbenefitsonhouseholdincometechnicalreportfinancialyearending2020\"> the Quality and Methodology Information </a></p>  Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.
