Definitions sourced from \u201cIncome and Living Conditions\u201d Metadata (Eurostat). <br> <br> Household income - The total disposable income of a household is calculated by adding together the personal income received by all of household members plus income received at household level. Missing income information is imputed. <br> <br> Disposable household income includes i) All income from work (employee wages and self-employment earnings), ii) Private income from investment and property, iii) Transfers between households, iv) All social transfers received in cash including old-age pensions  Note - Some of the income components are mandatory only from 2007 - Imputed rent, Interest paid on mortgage, and v) Employer's social insurance contributions. From 2007 onwards, all countries have to supply gross income information. <br> The current definition of total household disposable income used for the calculation of EU-SILC based indicators excludes i) Imputed rent - i.e. money that one saves on full (market) rent by living in one's own accommodation or in accommodation rented at a price that is lower than the market rent, and ii) Non monetary income components, in particular value of goods produced for own consumption, social transfers in kind and non-cash employee income except company cars. <br> <br> Equivalence scale - To take into account the impact of differences in household size and composition, the total disposable household income is \"equivalised\". The equivalised income attributed to each member of the household is calculated by dividing the total disposable income of the household by the equivalisation factor. <br> <br> Equivalisation factors can be determined in various ways. Eurostat applies an equivalisation factor calculated according to the OECD-modified scale first proposed in 1994.

Northern Ireland and total UK figures for percentage of forest area with a long-term management plan, and forest area annual net change prior to 2013 are not shown here, as estimates before the change in methodology are not directly comparable to those after. Figures for calculating these are, however, available at <a href=\"https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/statistics-by-topic/woodland-statistics/\">Forest Research</a>.</p><p>The land area and forest area measurements used here are \u2018flat\u2019 as they do not take into account variations in relief e.g. mountains and valleys.</p><h3>Biomass stock</h3><p>Data for biomass stock are estimated using National Forest Inventory (NFI) estimates of 218 thousand oven dry tonnes for conifers, and 208 thousand oven dry tonnes for broadleaves in Great Britain (GB). It is assumed that the volume of deadwood per hectare is unchanged over time, and that all estimates per hectare for the UK are similar to GB levels. Growing stock estimates have been used to uprate GB biomass figures from the NFI report to UK figures and to derive a time series.</p><p>More information on biomass can be found in the Forestry Commission publication on <a href=\"https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/research/biomass-in-live-woodland-trees-in-britain/\">Biomass in live woodland trees in Britain</a>.</p><h3>Protected areas</h3><p>For Great Britain, the woodland area within legally protected areas has been estimated by overlaying the National Forest Inventory woodland map with maps of designated areas. Geological Sites of Special Scientific Interest have been excluded from this analysis, as the designation in these cases is unlikely to be related to the presence of woodland. A similar analysis was undertaken by the Northern Ireland Forest Service for the Forest Resources Assessment 2015.</p><h3>Long-term management plans</h3><p>All Forestry England, Forestry and Land Scotland, Natural Resources Wales, and Forest Service woodland from 2000 is assumed to have a long-term management plan. For private sector woodland, the area of woodland with a long-term management plan has been estimated from data held in administrative systems for Grants & Regulations, or for areas of certified woodland (if this is larger). This is likely to undercount the true level of woodland with a long-term management plan.</p><h3>Independently verified management certification schemes</h3><p>Independently verified management certification schemes for the UK are the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) scheme and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) scheme. Many woodlands are certified under both. Certified woodland areas are often used as an indicator of sustainable forest management, however, woodland that is not certified may also be sustainably managed. Some choose not to become certified due to the cost involved and there may be little incentive for woodland owners to get their woodlands certified if timber production is not a major objective.</p><p>New certificates may relate to existing woodland that was not previously certified, or to newly planted areas.</p><h3>Further information</h3><p>For further information on the methodology and quality of woodland area estimates please see the <a href=\"https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/statistics-by-topic/woodland-statistics/\">Forest Research Woodland Statistics</a>.</p><p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.

Methodology for calculating material footprint is complex and the approach used can impact on the figures. These data give the latest estimates using a method developed by the University of Leeds, updating the time series where revised data are available, and including figures for 2018. Data are presented for the UK.</p> <p>Previously, there were published estimates of the UK\u2019s material footprint using the Eurostat approach, using a tool which is publicly available. The Eurostat method uses coefficients, which estimate the quantity of a raw material required for a given product in a given year. In the latest version of the tool, the coefficients were calculated for the EU27 (the UK was excluded). It has therefore not been possible to provide updated estimates for the UK material footprint using the Eurostat approach.

Housing costs such as rent, Council Tax, mortgage payments etc. are excluded from the measure, meaning expenditure is counted on an \u2018after housing costs\u2019 (AHC)  basis. </p><p>Household Income - The measure we use for income is household disposable income, AHC. Disposable income is the amount of money that households have available for spending and saving after direct taxes (such as Income Tax, National Insurance and Council Tax) and pension contributions have been accounted for. It includes earnings from employment, private pensions and investments as well as cash benefits provided by the state. </p><p>Reflecting household size - The expenditure and income measures used in this analysis are all equivalised. Equivalisation is the process of accounting for the fact that households with many members are likely to need a higher income to achieve the same standard of living as households with fewer members.

The LCF is an annual survey of the expenditure and income of private households; people living in hotels, lodging houses and institutions such as old people\u2019s homes are excluded. It is the only data source to collect detailed data on both income and expenditure, thereby allowing analysis of the two measures. </p><p>As with all surveys, there are some limitations to be aware of. The LCF is known to not fully capture those at the poorest and richest ends of income distribution and suffers from non-response error. When analysing inequalities, this can impact on the representation of the target population (in this case, the bottom 40%) and the overall appearance of income distribution. </p><p>In international comparisons, data has been sourced from the World Bank, and data for the UK comes from Eurostat\u2019s  European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). The EU-SILC collects data on poverty, income, social exclusion and living conditions.

Official development assistance (ODA) - The DAC defines ODA as \u201cthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent) (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). Other official flows (OOF) - Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf - Para 24). Bilateral Aid -  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid -  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.  Purpose Codes - The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases.

Based on this principle, a relevant disaggregation is most often defined as any classification that follows \"by\" in the title of the indicator, for example \"by age and sex\".  This working definition excludes cases where the title of the indicator includes sub-indicators, such as Indicator 2.5.2 - \"Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or at unknown level of risk of extinction\" \u2013 risk level is a sub-indicator rather than a disaggregation. Also, excluded are any references to the sample the indicator requires data for, such as Indicator 5.3.1 - \"Proportion of women aged 20-24 years who were married or in a union before age 15 and before age 18\" \u2013 sex and age are not disaggregations, but the sample required by the indicator.","computation_calculations":"Based on the definition above, across all goals 50 indicators were identified as containing specific disaggregations within the title. This number was used as the denominator for calculating the proportion of indicators with full disaggregation. The number of reported indicators on the UK SDG platform that fully achieve the disaggregation identified in their title are divided by the total number of indicators identified to contain disaggregation in their title (that is, 50). This number is then multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage of indicators with full disaggregation across all goals. The same process is followed for indicators that have available data only for some of the disaggregations identified in the title, in order to obtain percentage of indicators with achieved partial disaggregation. Likewise for indicators that require disaggregation in the title, but no data is available on the platform. In addition, a proxy variable counts towards achieving a required disaggregation. For example indicator 2.2.2 requires prevalence of malnutrition by type (wasting and overweight), which is achieved by using a classification by Body Mass Index (BMI) - obese, overweight, and underweight.\nWhen the data is additionally disaggregated by goal, the percentage represents the completeness of disaggregation (fully, partially, not disaggregated) based on the number of indicators identified to require disaggregation within that particular goal, rather than the total 50 indicators across all goals. Based on the outlined definition, Goals 6, 7 ,13, and 14 do not have any indicators that require disaggregation.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"bar","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":null,"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2020,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"UK","source_url_1":"https://sdgdata.gov.uk/","source_url_text_1":"UK data for the Sustainable Development Goals","source_statistical_classification_1":"Experimental","source_contact_1":"SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"All the data used for calculating the reported proportions is sourced from the indicators information available on the UK SDG platform","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"17-18-01","other_info":"The data reported here represents a snapshot from the end of the particular year.

Imports are assigned to a product sector based on their 6 digit code, rather than the 8 digit code provided on the database. This is because at 8 digit level codes are frequently altered. Therefore, when mapping sectors using the most recently updated tariff schedule, import product codes from prior years will not be captured in instances where they have been updated. To overcome this, sectors are assigned to one 6 digit code only. Other caveats to consider - AVEs are calculated on the basis of trade between the UK and the EU between 2017-2018. This may not fully reflect the trading relationship between the UK and Developing nations, Least Developed nations and Small Island Developing Nations. To this end, the use of EU imports (as opposed to Rest of the World) could yield AVE inflationary effects, as EU imports are generally of higher quantity and higher price than imports from Rest of World. Where no trade has been recorded in 2017-18 between the UK-EU no AVE estimates have been derived for these goods in the sample. Additionally, missing values for both AVE rates and sectors arising from product code alterations affect the sample size. For AVEs, some of these missing values are overcome by 0% allocation where imports belong to regimes U10 (MFN Zero), U20 (GSP Zero) or U30 (Preference Zero). However, since such replacements cannot be made for non-zero tariff rate regimes, samples may contain disproportionate amounts of 0% rate tariffs, in turn, potentially yielding underestimating effects on average tariffs calculations.

The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main components - i) Enabling environment - this includes the policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the \u2018enabling environment\u2019 for IWRM; ii) Institutions - includes the range and roles of political, social, economic and administrative institutions that help to support the implementation of IWRM; iii) Management Instruments - The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions; iv) Financing - Budgeting and financing made available and used for water resources development and management from various sources. The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main components (UNEP 2016). Each component is split into two parts - questions concerning the \u2018National level\u2019 and \u2018Other levels\u2019 respectively. \u2018Other levels\u2019 includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate.

Within the CSV, Local Authority is comprised of Counties and Unitary Authorities.","computation_calculations":"Background annual average PM2.5\u00a0concentrations for the year of interest are modelled on a 1km x 1km grid using an air dispersion model, and calibrated using measured concentrations taken from background sites in Defra\u2019s Automatic Urban and Rural Network (http://uk- air.defra.gov.uk/interactive-map.) Data on primary emissions from different sources and a combination of measurement data for secondary inorganic aerosol and models for sources not included in the emission inventory (including re-suspension of dusts) are used to estimate the anthropogenic (human-made) component of these concentrations. By approximating LA boundaries to the 1km by 1km grid, and using census population data, population weighted background PM2.5\u00a0concentrations for each lower tier LA are calculated. This work is completed under contract to Defra, as a small extension of its obligations under the Ambient Air Quality Directive (2008/50/EC). Concentrations of anthropogenic, rather than total, PM2.5\u00a0are used as the basis for this indicator, as burden estimates based on total PM2.5\u00a0might give a misleading impression of the scale of the potential influence of policy interventions (COMEAP, 2012).","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"Please note the y axis does not go to 100% for ease of visualisation.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Fraction of all-cause adult mortality attributable to ambient anthropogenic particulate air pollution (measured as fine particulate matter, PM2.5)","data_show_map":true,"data_keywords":"map","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) and Air Pollution and Climate Change Group Public Health England (COMEAP)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2010,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"England","source_url_1":"https://data.england.nhs.uk/dataset/phe-indicator-30101","source_url_text_1":"3.01 Fraction of mortality attributable to particulate air pollution","source_release_date_1":"05/10/2017","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_other_info_1":"An increase of 10 ug/m3 in population-weighted annual average background concentration of\u00a0PM2.5* is assumed to increase all-cause mortality rates by a unit relative risk (RR) factor of 1.06.

Currently, there is no definitive source of data or suitable method available to accurately quantify the number of victims of offences that fall under modern slavery in the UK. The hidden nature of the crime makes producing an accurate prevalence measure difficult. Instead, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has brought together a range of available data sources on known victims and cases of modern slavery to provide a better understanding of the extent and nature of the crime. See the [Modern slavery in the UK - March 2020](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/modernslaveryintheuk/march2020) article and [appendix tables](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/modernslaveryintheukappendixtables) for the data.\n\n##### Key findings from the article include - \n* Greater awareness, increases in reporting and improvements in police recording are likely to have contributed to the increases seen in potential victim numbers in the UK since the introduction of the modern slavery Acts across the UK in 2015.\n* The number of potential victims referred through the UK National Referral Mechanism (NRM) increased by 36% to 6,985 in the year ending December 2018. Almost half of the referrals (45%) were potential victims aged under 18 years (see [Appendix table 1](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/modernslaveryintheukappendixtables)). (Source - Home Office \u2013 UK)\n* In the year ending June 2019, 55% of potential adult victims supported in England and Wales were female and 44% were male (see [Appendix table 36](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/modernslaveryintheukappendixtables)). The type of exploitation experienced varied by sex of victim. For example, in the year ending June 2019, domestic servitude and sexual exploitation were predominantly experienced by females (83% and 98% respectively), whereas labour exploitation was mostly experienced by males (86%) (see [Figure 7 of the article](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/modernslaveryintheuk/march2020) and [Appendix table 39](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/modernslaveryintheukappendixtables)).

Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid -  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations. Purpose Codes - The DAC Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.

These standards specify maximum annual average concentrations for specific water pollutants. The specific requirements differ depending on which type of surface water body is being monitored. Chemical status is measured as either good or fail. If part of a water body fails on any one of the criteria monitored, it will fail to achieve or lose good status.

The introduction of new Water Framework Directive (WFD) monitoring data and classification standards (including a new baseline adopting all of the new standards, tools, designations and water body boundaries) in 2014 has led to a step change in the number of water bodies assessed as being in each status class in following years. </p><p>The formal reporting of new standards in cycle 2 of WFD has used the second cycle plans published in 2015. The introduction of reporting the cycle 2 standards has differed amongst the UK countries. The percentage of water bodies in each status class has been calculated based on the total number of water bodies assessed in each year. The number of water body assessments included varies slightly from year to year. The reductions in the number of assessments made in 2015 and 2016 were primarily due to Wales and then England adopting the monitoring and classification standards laid down in Cycle 2 of the WFD.

Multilateral Aid -  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.  Purpose Codes - The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.

The strategy covers all non-native species of flora and fauna with the exception of genetically modified organisms, bacteria and viruses.\n\nIn our [6th National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity](http://data.jncc.gov.uk/data/527ff89f-5f6b-4e06-bde6-b823e0ddcb9a/UK-CBD-6NR-v2-web.pdf), the UK report progress against Aichi Target 9 - by 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment of invasive alien species. The assessment concluded we were making progress towards the target but at an insufficient rate.\n\nThe report stated that - Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) are managed on a Great Britain and all-Ireland basis in the British Isles, with countries working closely together to co-ordinate their efforts. Priority species have been identified following extensive scientific review and expert input and a framework to prioritise their management have been developed. Comprehensive risk analysis processes are in place (including horizon scanning, risk assessment and risk management), as are new information systems and contingency plans to support rapid response. Despite strong action, currently the number of INNS established in Britain has remained constant, in terrestrial environments, and has increased in the freshwater and marine environment.  \n\nFurther information on the UK status against treaties and Action Plans, National Reports and National Legislation relating to invasive non-native species can be found on the [InforMEA](https://www.informea.org/en/countries/GB/parties) website. Invasive non-native species are covered in a range of laws and action plans, and can be found by using the filter bar across the top of the page. \n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2020-07-03","national_data_updated_date":"2019-04-18","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2020-07-03: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/7141a1e8a904c110721f533c298255df0f43c841","national_data_update_url_text":"2019-04-18: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/856dc1b4c325685125dca5b072db4d48bd7e1246","indicator":"15.8.1","target_id":"15.8","sdg_goal":"15","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"global_indicators.15-8-1-title"},"8-10-1":{"indicator_name":"global_indicators.8-10-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.8-10-title","indicator_number":"8.10.1","csv_size":"690.379 kB","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Monetary Fund (IMF)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=8&Target=8.10","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 8.10","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Number per 100,000 adults","computation_definitions":"Commercial bank branches are retail locations of resident commercial banks and other resident banks that function as commercial banks that provide financial services to customers and are physically separated.

Measures therefore differ slightly to those on <a href=\"https://www.sdg661.app/\">Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer</a>, a GSWE platform for presenting data specifically for this indicator.</p><p>Persistent cloud cover can impact the quality of data collection. Anomalous years (likely due to cloud cover - 1994 to 1998 and 2004 to 2009) have therefore been excluded from the data presented here, with the exception of the baseline. The baseline period of 2001 to 2005 includes the anomalous years 2004 and 2005. To mitigate the impact of variable cloud cover, the modal value of each pixel across the baseline years has been used to calculate the average spatial extent in the baseline period. Further details on the source data and mitigating the impacts of these anomalous periods is provided in the <a href=\"https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/projects/quality- and-methodology-extent-and-change-of-surface-water-statistics\">Data Science Campus Quality and Methodology document</a>.</p><p>HydroBASIN catchments are identified with numbers, however we have added descriptive names to each catchment in the dropdown menu - these are not official names. Work is in progress to provide interactive maps. While these are not yet available here, they can be viewed in the blog <a href=\"https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/using-satellite-imagery-to-report-changes-to-water-bodies-for-sdg-6-6-1\">Using satellite imagery to report changes to water for SDG 6.6.1</a>.</p><p><b>Groundwater</b></p><p>Groundwater level data is obtained from BGS WellMaster database, derived from 154 groundwater level monitoring stations to provide groundwater estimates for 19 of the 34 HydroBasins in the UK. HydroBasin catchments are identified with numbers, however descriptive name have been added to the dropdown menu, these are not official names.</p><p>The chosen five-year reference period for the analysis is 1990 to 1994. Values greater than 100% imply average groundwater levels have risen since the period 1990 to 1994, while values less than 100% imply falling levels.</p><p>The data monitored by measuring authorities in each nation (EA, SEPA, NRW, DAERA) are passed to BGS periodically. All chosen sites have the following - monitoring frequencies of greater than one observation a month, are monitoring boreholes where groundwater levels are not systematically affected by abstraction, and are representative of local and regional groundwater systems.</p><p>Raw data is quality assured by measuring authority and are expected to be accurate to less than +/- 0.01 metre for data collected since 1990. On receipt by BGS an additional check is made to ensure all values fall within expected hydrogeologicaly plausible ranges.</p><p>Please note, the headline figure for UK show average percentage change across hydrobasins for which values are available (not all hydrobasins are represented), not the % change across hydrobasins.</p><p><b>Reservoir</b></p><p>It is recognised that reservoirs are not traditional water ecosystems that necessarily warrant protection and restoration, but many countries hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and thus has been included. Thereby, including data on reservoirs countries can better understand changes occurring to artificial water bodies in conjunction with changes occurring to natural waterbodies.</p><p>The reservoirs dataset is derived from GSWE, with 2000 to 2004 being the chosen baseline period. See<a href=\"https://map.sdg661.app/\"> Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer</a> for further information.<p></p><b>Lake water quality</b></p><p>Turbidity is derived from suspended solids concentration estimated and tropphic state index comes from phytoplankton biomass by proxy of cholorphyll-a</p><p>The chosen baseline period is 2006 to 2010 and includes five monthly averages across the five years of observation for this period. From theses five years of data, 12 monthly averages (one for each month of the year) for trophic and turbidity were derived. A further set of observations were then used to calculate change from baseline. These monthly data comprise years 2017 to 2019. Lake quality percentages can be classified as; 0 to 25% (low), 25 to 50% (medium), 50 to 75% (high) and 75 to 100% (extreme). A lake is catergorised as being 'affected' when the value for turbidity/trophic state exceeds 50%, when compared to the lakes baseline value.</p><p>Products in period 2006 to 2010 are based on observations from the Meris sensor, whereas 2017 to 2019 used OCLI sensors. Most accurate water quality sensors have 250 to 350 metre resolutions, while less accurate sensors detect turbidity/trophic state changes to 100m resolution. Land/water buffer maps as well as ice maps were applied to improve accuracy of the data.</p><p>Please note, the data is not informing whether a lake is considered to be good/bad quality, only that a lake water event has occurred and been recorded. Also, turbidity and trophic state are an indirect indication for water quality, but do perform a successful proxy role.

Based on this principle, a relevant disaggregation is most often defined as any classification that follows \"by\" in the title of the indicator, for example \"by age and sex\".  This working definition excludes cases where the title of the indicator includes sub-indicators, such as Indicator 3.5.1 - \"Coverage of treatment interventions (pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services) for substance use disorders\" \u2013 treatment intervention is a sub-indicator rather than a disaggregation. Also, excluded are any references to the sample the indicator requires data for, such as Indicator 5.3.1 - \"Proportion of women aged 20-24 years who were married or in a union before age 15 and before age 18\" \u2013 sex and age are not disaggregations, but the sample required by the indicator.","computation_calculations":"Based on the definition above, across all goals 53 indicators were identified as containing specific disaggregations within the title. This number was used as the denominator for calculating the proportion of indicators with full disaggregation. The number of reported indicators on the UK SDG platform that fully achieve the disaggregation identified in their title are divided by the total number of indicators identified to contain disaggregation in their title (that is, 53). This number is then multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage of indicators with full disaggregation across all goals. The same process is followed for indicators that have available data only for some of the disaggregations identified in the title, in order to obtain percentage of indicators with achieved partial disaggregation.<br><br> Likewise for indicators that require disaggregation in the title, but no data is available on the platform. In addition, a proxy variable counts towards achieving a required disaggregation. For example indicator 2.2.2 requires prevalence of malnutrition by type (wasting and overweight), which is achieved by using a classification by Body Mass Index (BMI) - obese, overweight, and underweight. When the data is additionally disaggregated by goal, the percentage represents the completeness of disaggregation (fully, partially, not disaggregated) based on the number of indicators identified to require disaggregation within that particular goal, rather than the total 53 indicators across all goals.<br><br>Based on the outlined definition, Goals 6, 7 ,13, and 14 do not have any indicators that require disaggregation.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"The calculated numbers for 2020 are based on a denominator of 50 indicators that require diaggregation in the title.

The measure of income used is before housing costs  Missing income information is imputed. <br> <br> Disposable household income includes i) All income from work (employee wages and self-employment earnings), ii) Private income from investment and property, iii) Transfers between households, iv) All social transfers received in cash including old-age pensions  Note - Some of the income components are mandatory only from 2007 - Imputed rent, and Interest paid on mortgage, and v) Employer's social insurance contributions. <br> From 2007 onwards, all countries have to supply gross income information. <br> The current definition of total household disposable income used for the calculation of EU-SILC based indicators excludes i) Imputed rent - i.e. money that one saves on full (market) rent by living in one's own accommodation or in accommodation rented at a price that is lower than the market rent, and ii) Non monetary income components, in particular value of goods produced for own consumption, social transfers in kind and non-cash employee income except company cars.<br> <br> Equivalence scale - To take into account the impact of differences in household size and composition, the total disposable household income is \"equivalised\". The equivalised income attributed to each member of the household is calculated by dividing the total disposable income of the household by the equivalisation factor. <br> Equivalisation factors can be determined in various ways. Eurostat applies an equivalisation factor calculated according to the OECD-modified scale first proposed in 1994.

Imports are assigned to a product sector based on their 6 digit code, rather than the 8 digit code provided on the database. This is because at 8 digit level codes are frequently altered. Therefore, when mapping sectors using the most recently updated tariff schedule, import product codes from prior years will not be captured in instances where they have been updated. To overcome this, sectors are assigned to one 6 digit code only. Other caveats to consider - AVEs are calculated on the basis of trade between the UK and the EU between 2017-2018. This may not reflect well the trading relationship between the UK and Developing nations, Least Developed nations and Small Island Developing Nations. To this end, the use of EU imports (as opposed to Rest of the World) could yield AVE inflationary effects, as EU imports are generally of higher quantity and higher price than imports from Rest of World. Where no trade has been recorded in 2017-18 between the UK-EU no AVE estimates have been derived for these goods in the sample. Additionally, missing values for both AVE rates and sectors arising from product code alterations affect the sample size. For AVEs, some of these missing values are overcome by 0% allocation where imports belong to regimes U10 (MFN Zero), U20 (GSP Zero) or U30 (Preference Zero). However, since such replacements cannot be made for non-zero tariff rate regimes, samples may contain disproportionate amounts of 0% rate tariffs, in turn, potentially yielding underestimating effects on simple average tariffs and weighted average tariffs calculations. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-02-02","national_data_updated_date":"2022-02-02","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-02-02: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/ab65028596e78a6f09daf95c120e579d373d48bf","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-02-02: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/ab65028596e78a6f09daf95c120e579d373d48bf","indicator":"17.10.1","target_id":"17.10","sdg_goal":"17"},"3-2-1":{"indicator_name":"global_indicators.3-2-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.3-2-title","indicator_number":"3.2.1","csv_size":"24.256 kB","indicator_available":"Number of deaths of children under 5 years per 1,000 live births","national_indicator_description":"The average number of expected deaths before the age of 5 per 1,000 live births for a specific year.","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEFF)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=3&Target=3.2","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 3.2","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Rate per 1,000 live births","computation_definitions":"Under-five mortality is the probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births.","computation_calculations":"The probability of a child born in a specific year dying prior to the age of 5 years is calculated by first calculating the number of deaths of children below 5 years of age for a specific year and then dividing this value by the number of live births for the same year.

The specific definition that applies to the data presented is - An activity that 'contributes to the objective of stabilisation of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system by promoting efforts to reduce or limit GHG emissions or to enhance GHG sequestration.' (OECD DAC Rio Markers for Climate - Handbook).<p>Cross-cutting - Cross-cutting across mitigation and adaptation.<p>Other - This category was used up to 2016 to account for spend in cross-cutting programmes that could not be broken down into mitigation and adaptation elements. Since 2016 more spend has been able to be reported as either mitigation and adaptation, with any spend not able to be broken reported as cross-cutting.</p><p>UNFCCC - <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/about-us/about-the-secretariat\">The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>. <p> OECD - <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a>.","computation_calculations":"The headline figure is the sum of values for all adaptation, mitigation, cross-cutting, and other funding for the year in question.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"Displayed values are rounded to 3 significant figures.","data_start_values":[{"field":"Theme","value":"Total"}],"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Provision of climate-specific public financial support","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"climate change, global warming, finance, government spending, ODA","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)","source_periodicity_1":"Biennial","source_earliest_available_1":2011,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://unfccc.int/BRs","source_url_text_1":"Biennial Reports - Annex I","source_release_date_1":"31/12/2019","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_contact_1":"secretariat@unfccc.int","source_other_info_1":"The source link will take you to the most recent report.
