MGCI is defined as the percentage of green cover over the total surface of the mountain region of a given country and for given reporting year. The aim of the index is to monitor the evolution of the green cover and thus assess the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems.","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=15&Target=15.4","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 15.4","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Square Km, Index","computation_definitions":"<p>Mountain elevation 5 - An elevation of 1,000 to 1,500 meters and a slope greater than 5, or a local elevation range above the surrounding area of at least 300 meters for a 7 kilometer radius.<p>Mountain elevation 6 - An elevation of 300 to 1,000 meters and a local elevation range above the surrounding area of at least 300 meters for a 7 kilometer radius.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"FAO estimate.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Mountain Green Cover Index","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Mountain; Green cover; Index; Environment; Geography; FAO","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2000,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/?indicator=15.4.2","source_url_text_1":"SDG Indicator 15.4.2 - Mountain Green Cover","source_release_date_1":"21/05/2021","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official international","source_contact_1":"http://www.fao.org/mountain-partnership/contact/en/","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"15-04-02","other_info":"Please see the <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=15&Target=15.4\">Global metadata</a> for more information, including calculations and limitations of the data.
