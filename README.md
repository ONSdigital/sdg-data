# SDG Data Repository

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ONSdigital/sdg-data.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/ONSdigital/sdg-data)
 [![LICENSE.](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-OGL--3-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)

This repository holds the UK data for SDG reporting. The data is served via a static http server.

# Servers

The develop branch serves from the `gh-pages` branch on this repository. This is for staging.

The master branch serves from the main deployment org and is for prod.

# Routes:

Loosely speaking with have: `/<datatype>/<id>.<format>` and support csv and json file formats. You can also look at the file structure at https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/tree/gh-pages and it shows how it's all laid out.

## Versions

We don't currently support API versioning.

## Data

The main data set, the raw data lives in `/data/` in the repo.

```
/data/<id>.<format>

/data/1-2-1.csv
/data/1-2-1.json
```

e.g. https://ONSdigital.github.io/sdg-data/data/1-2-1.json

### Edges

```
/edges/1-2-1.csv

/edges/1-2-1.json
```

### Combined data and edges

```
/comb/1-2-1.csv
/comb/1-2-1.json
```

## Metadata

```
/meta/<id>.json
```

## Statistics

Statistics generated from the data and metadata. Currently just the reporting status statistics.

```
/stats/reporting.json
```

## Build time routes

At build time you'll need everything. Rather than making you download each indicator separately we have an ID of `all` which you can use.

### Headline data

Headlines json comes formatted as records, instead of in list format.

```
/headline/<id>.<format>
/headline/all.json
```


### Metadata

The following is all metadata for all indicators in one blob for the build.

```
/meta/all.json
```

It's a JSON object with `{<id>: <meta>}` pairs.

Scripts:

* `check_data.py`: Runs data and metadata checks and will prevent deployment if fails.
* `build_data.py`: Builds main data, headline, and edges output in csv, and json.

Packages:

This uses the `sdg` package from the `sdg-build` repository during the build.
