This guidance will help you to set up a Git Bash terminal on your computer.
Git Bash will make updating the SDG repositories much faster and easier.
For instance, you can move and delete files and create new folders.

All commands to be entered into the Git Bash terminal are marked with '##'.
This is just to make them stand out - don't include '##' when entering the command.

There are 3 stages:
1. Installing Git Bash
2. Generating deploy keys
3. Adding deploy keys to your account
	a. public key (deploy_key.pub)
	b. private key (deploy_key)

-----------------

1. Installing Git Bash

Install Git Bash for Windows from https://git-scm.com/download/win (or search 'Git Bash download').
Follow the installation instructions, selecting the default settings (i.e. click Next), except for...
Use the Git Bash terminal rather than Windows terminal (choose 'Use Git from Git Bash only' - the first option).

2. Generating deploy keys

Choose a location to save your private/public key pair.
I recommend creating a folder in your C drive called 'repo',
where you will clone your repos, and make a folder inside 'repo' called 'key'.

When you have done this, set your working directory (cd) to the 'key' folder.
Open the 'Git Bash' terminal (search for it with the Windows buton), and then
set your working directory to the 'key' folder using the 'cd' command:
## cd /c/repo/key
## explorer .   (optional - this opens your working directory as a window)
Note: if you save it somewhere else, just substitute '/c/repo/key' for your directory in the commands below.

Login to GitHub, and then link your account to the terminal using:
## git config --global user.name "GITHUB USERNAME"
## git config --global user.email "GITHUB EMAIL ADDRESS"
Note: You can press the 'up' key to show previous commands, and paste using SHIFT + INS.

Now you will generate the deploy key pair (private / public) for this GitHub user.
These deploy keys allow you to edit via Git Bash, but only on the machine you set it up on.
## ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "GITHUB EMAIL ADDRESS"

You will be asked 'enter a file in which to save the key'...
## /c/repo/key/deploy_key
This will create two files called 'deploy key' in the 'key' folder.
No password required (just hit ENTER twice when prompted) but you can add one if you wish.
Note: if you do enter a password, you won't see any text as you type.

Go to the key folder, where the two deploy keys have been generated.
## explorer .

deploy_key.pub is your PUBLIC key (it has a green icon).
This has to be copied to GitHub.
deploy_key is you PRIVATE key (white page and no file extension).
Your private key must not be uploaded to GitHub!

3. Adding deploy keys to your account

a. public key (deploy_key.pub)

You need to add deploy_key.pub to your GitHub account. Copy it using the Git Bash terminal:
## clip < /c/repo/key/deploy_key.pub

Open github.com. Click on your profile pic (top right) and open Settings.
Go to 'SSH and GPG keys', add a new SSH key, and give it a name. Paste the key into the box (CTRL + V).
If it says '...RSA PRIVATE KEY' then do not save it - you have copied the private key by mistake.
If your email is visible at the bottom, you've done it right and you can save the SSH key.

b. private key (deploy_key)

You need to add your private key to your computer's SSH agent.
## $ eval $(ssh-agent -s)

Add deploy_key to your list of SSH keys using:
ssh-add /c/repo/key/deploy_key

-----------------

Job's a good'un, you are now set up to use Git Bash!
Practice cloning a site (See 'Using Git Bash.txt') and pushing a change to the repository.
When you do you this, your key in Settings > SSH and GPG Keys is activated and turns green.

This one-off installation process has been successful, and you can use Git Bash as long as you are logged into GitHub.

Note: the NISR 'dlink' WiFi seems to have a security feature that prevents you cloning
or pushing changes. I suggest using an alternate network or ask your IT team to help.
