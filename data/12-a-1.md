  Solar PV- The direct conversion of solar radiation into electricity by the interaction of light with the electrons in a semiconductor device or cell. Bioenergy - renewable energy made from material of recent biological
  origin derived from plant or animal matter, known as biomass. AD -
  Anaerobic Digestion  is a natural process in which microorganisms break down organic matter, in the absence of oxygen, into biogas (a mixture of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane) and digestate (a nitrogen-rich fertiliser). The biogas can be used directlyin engines for Combined Heat and
  Power (CHP), burned to produce heat, or can be cleaned and used in the same way as natural gas or as a vehicle fuel.

  Source 1 contains an estimate of non-fossil fuelled capacity used for co-firing of renewables based on the proportion of generation accounted for by the renewable source. This is applicable for Other Bioenergy  and the sub category Biomass and Waste. Also in each year some sites have not
  been attributed to a region so that data related to individual companies are not disclosed. This information is contained within the tables in source 1. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
