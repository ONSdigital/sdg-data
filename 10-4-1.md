  Labour Share of GDP seeks to inform about the relative share of GDP which accrues to workers as compared to the share which accrues to capital in each reference period.Â  In Periods of economic recession this figure provides an indication of the extent to which falling output reduces
  labour income relative to profits. If Labour income falls at a greater rate than profits the labour income share will be expected to fall. Increased production and GDP often lead to improved living standards, depending on the distribution of real income and public policy among other
  factors, which are reflected in this indicator.  Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

The methodology used to compile this data differs from the labour share published in the [Labour Productivity national statistic release](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/bulletins/labourproductivity/octobertodecember2018), because it excludes the impact of the self-employed.  Further information can be found in the [Labour productivity, UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/bulletins/labourproductivity/octobertodecember2018) release and this [article](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/methodologies/estimatingtheimpactoftheselfemployedinthelabourshare).
