# This config file is for use with the `build_data` and `check_data` functions,
# which are helpers for implementations of Open SDG. This file allows easy use
# of those functions without altering Python code.

# Languages
# ---------
# This tells sdg-build to perform "translated builds" for each of the specified
# languages. Each build is in its own subfolder - one for each language.
languages:
  - en

# Destination directory
# ---------------------
# This identifies a directory to hold the "built" files. The default is '_site'.
site_dir: _site

# Schema file
# -----------
# This identifies a file containing the schema (possible fields) for metadata.
# Currently this needs to be a prose.io config, and defaults to '_prose.yml'.
schema_file: _prose.yml

# Source directory
# ----------------
# This identifies the directory that holds the 'data' and 'meta' folders.
# The default, '', points to the root of this repository.
src_dir: ''

# Translation repositories
# ------------------------
# This tells sdg-build to import translations from Git repositories. Specific
# tags or branches should be indicated after an "@" symbol. The default is the
# GitHub repository 'sdg-translations'.
translations:
  - class: TranslationInputSdgTranslations
    source: https://github.com/open-sdg/sdg-translations.git
    tag: master

# Git
# ---
# This specifies whether or not to use Git dates to calculate the "last updated"
# date for data files.
git: true

# Git Data Director
# -----------------
# This specifies an alternate folder to look in for Git-versioned data files,
# when calculating the "last updated" dates for data files. This defaults to
# "data" (the folder where the data files actually exist.) Most sites will not
# need to change this setting. It is intended for sites where the data needs
# to be converted/processed/etc in some way before being processed by sdg-build.
git_data_dir: data
