indicator_available: Government expenditure per capita on natural and cultural heritage
national_indicator_description: Government expenditure per capita on natural and cultural heritage with a detailed breakdown of spending in both areas and by level of government.
un_designated_tier: Tier II
un_custodian_agency: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
goal_meta_link: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-11-04-01.pdf
goal_meta_link_text: United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)
national_geographical_coverage: United Kingdom
computation_units: GBP (£) per capita
computation_definitions: >-
  <p>Expenditure data has been extracted from annual expenditures of central and local government using UN Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) codes. </p><p> In this context, to approximate spending on 'Cultural heritage' we include that which is defined under 'Cultural
  services' (GF0802) .</p><p>Similarly for 'Natural heritage', we use data that reflects central Government expenditure on UK biodiversity. However, this does not include some aspects of the full definition provided in the UN metadata. This data only includes spending provided solely for
  the protection and promotion of biodiversity and generally excludes operational costs. </p><p> An 'NGO' refers to a 'Non-governmental organisation'.</p>
computation_calculations: Per capita is calculated by - (Expenditure on 'cultural heritage' or 'natural heritage' / UK Mid-Year Population)*1,000,000

data_footnote: >-
  </p><p> 1. Expenditure data for 'Cultural heritage' has been extracted from annual expenditures of central and local government using UN Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) codes for 'Cultural services' GF0802.</p> 2.     Data for government expenditure on 'Natural
  heritage' is based on public sector spending on UK biodiversity, therefore it only includes spending provided solely for the protection and promotion of biodiversity and generally excludes operational costs. It includes spending by central government and not that by local
  authorities.</p><p> 3. Figures for UK public sector expenditure on biodiversity are presented as financial year data in the source publication. In this indicator, they have been allocated to the calendar year in which the majority of the financial year falls. For example, data for the
  financial year April 2019 to March 2020 has been combined with the mid-year population estimates for 2019 to calculate a per capita expenditure figure for the calendar year 2019. </p><p> 4. Figures for UK public sector expenditure on biodiversity in the source publication are deflated
  using the UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator. Therefore, per capita expenditure figures presented in this indicator are in constant (most recent year) prices and account for the effects of inflation.</p><p> 5. Given the large number of UK public sector organisations funding
  activities related to biodiversity and the complexities involved in both defining and identifying relevant expenditure, the figures presented in this indicator are likely to be an underestimation of total biodiversity spend by the UK public sector.</p><p> 6. The data reported for NGOs is
  collated predominantly from published annual accounts/financial reports. Almost all of the NGOs included in this data are registered as charities and detailed annual financial reports are published on the Charity Commission website. </p>
