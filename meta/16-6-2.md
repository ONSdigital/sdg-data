  Data are collected from the Eurofound 'European Quality of Life Survey'. Income is presented by income quartiles (from lowest income quartile 1 to highest income quartile 4), which were calculated based on equivalised income in PPP euros for the respondents who provided this information.
  Cases with missing values (for example when asked for respondents perceived quality of services, they answered "don't know", or refused to answer spontaneously) have been included in the calculations where the respondent has rated at least three services. Where there were fewer than
  fifty responses from a group, the results are not shown. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration
  with topic experts.
