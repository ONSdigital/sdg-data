  <p>Adults aged 16 years and over were asked to rate their overall satisfaction with certain public services in the UK on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 was "not at satisfied" and 10 was "completely satisfied". A rating score of 6 or higher represents satisfaction with the asked about
  public service in the UK.</p><p>When interpreting the latest estimates and the presented assessments of change, the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on individual’s attitudes and survey responses, as well as the impact on data collection, should be kept in mind, given the
  major disruption COVID-19 caused in people’s lives.</p><p>Survey estimates exclude respondents who refused to answer, answered "Don't know" and those with missing answers.</p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to
  identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
