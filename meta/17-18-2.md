**Non-statistical indicator**

The UK fulfils the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics which are outlined in the [indicator metadata](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-17-18-02.pdf).  To meet the requirements of this indicator, a country must fulfil all the ten principles adopted by the UN Statistical Commission in its 1994 Special Session. 

The fulfilment of these principles include the work of the [UK Statistics Authority (UKSA)](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/what-we-do/), and its regulatory arm, the [Office for Statistics Regulation](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/osr/).  

All producers of Official Statistics must adhere to the [UKSA Code of Practice](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/code-of-practice/). When producers of official statistics comply with the Code, it gives users of statistics and citizens confidence that published government statistics are of ***public value***, are ***high quality*** and are produced by people and organisations that are ***worthy of trust***.

All of this is underpinned by legislation in the [Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007]( https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/18/contents).
