national_indicator_available: Percentage of UK surface water bodies awarded ‘Good’ or ‘High’, by water body type, under the Water Framework Directive

  The purpose of the Water Framework Directive is to establish a framework for the protection of inland surface waters, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwater. The framework for delivering the Directive is through River Basin Management Planning.  The UK has been split into several
  River Basin Districts. Each River Basin District has been characterised into smaller management units known as Water Bodies. The surface Water Bodies may be rivers, lakes, estuary or coastal. Surface water status is measured by both its ecological and chemical status. It is assessed
  against the scale of high, good, moderate, poor
  and bad. The results published each year relate to data reported in that year under the Water Framework Directive.

  Figures are based on numbers of surface water bodies classified under the Water Framework Directive in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Includes rivers, canals (Northern Ireland does not report on canals), lakes, estuaries and coastal water bodies. Surface water status is
  measured by both its ecological and chemical status. It is assessed against the scale of high, good, moderate, poor and bad. The results published each year relate to data reported in that year under the Water Framework Directive. The ecological status of surface waters is assessed
  according to the following criteria- Biological quality (measured by composition and abundance of specified elements such as fish, benthic invertebrates, aquatic flora); Hydromorphological quality (measured by reference to elements such as river continuity, channel patterns, dynamics of
  flow or substrate of the river bed); and Physico-chemical quality (measured by reference to elements such as temperature, oxygenation, pH, nutrient conditions and the concentrations of specific pollutants [synthetic and non-synthetic]). The chemical status of surface waters is assessed
  according to the following criteria - Chemical quality (measured by reference to environmental quality standards for chemical substances at European level). These standards specify maximum annual average concentrations for specific water pollutants. The specific requirements differ
  depending on which type of surface water body is being monitored. Chemical status is measured as either good or fail. If part of a water body fails on any one of the criteria monitored, it will fail to achieve or lose good status. This is described as the "one out all out" approach.
computation_calculations: The percentage of water bodies in each status class has been calculated based on the total number of water bodies assessed in each year.

  Some small differences exist in the way the administrations and environment agencies implement the methods and tools for assessing water body status. The introduction of new Water Framework Directive monitoring data and classification standards (including a new baseline adopting all of
  the new standards, tools, designations and water body boundaries) in 2014 has led to a step change in the number of water bodies assessed as being in each status class in following years. The formal reporting of new standards in cycle 2 of Water Framework Directive has used the second
  cycle plans published in 2015.  The introduction of reporting the cycle 2 standards has differed amongst the UK countries.The percentage of water bodies in each status class has been calculated based on the total number of water bodies assessed in each year. The number of water body
  assessments included varies slightly from year to year - 10,832 water body assessments were included in 2009; 10,761 in 2010; 10,782 in 2011; 10,704 in 2012; 10,763 in 2013; 10,799 in 2014; 10,379 in 2015 and 9,297 in 2016. This reduction in the number assessed in 2016 was primarily due
  England moving to cycle 2, and the removal of a number of water bodies that were below the 10km2 catchment area in line with guidance. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
