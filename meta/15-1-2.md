  Area designation types, and IUCN management categories. To view these you will need to create a log in but this is free to do. Please note that the figures we present here differ slightly, because we include an extra set of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), namely Important Plant Areas.
  IBAT gives the option to view individual KBAs and Protected Areas on a map - by clicking on KBAs, and then on the name of the area the user is given more information on why it is classed as a KBA, and the species present. By clicking on Protected Areas, and then on the name of the area,
  the user is taken to the individual area on <a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/search-areas?geo_type=site">Protected Planet</a>. To use the map go to <a href="https://www.ibat-alliance.org/visual-data-map">Data Map</a> and make selections in Apply Layers.</p><p>The UK
  Biodiversity Indicators have related indicators for the UK - <a href="https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-c1-protected-areas/">C1 'Protected Areas'</a> includes 'Total extent of protected areas on land' (C1a), and 'Condition of areas/sites of Special Scientific Interest' (C1c).  The
