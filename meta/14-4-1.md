national_indicator_available: Percentage of marine fish (quota) stocks of UK interest 1) harvested sustainably; 2) with biomass at levels that maintain full reproductive capacity
national_indicator_description: >-
  The indicator comprises two broad measures – the percentage of fish stocks in seas around the UK that are 1) harvested sustainably ('exploitation level' series), and 2) at full reproductive capacity ('biologically sustainable status' series).  
  
  Measures are based on a group of 20
  species in 57 stocks for which there are reliable estimates that allow the sustainability of the stocks to be evaluated. The indicator stocks include a range of local and widely distributed species of major importance to the UK fishing industry.  
  
  Series on 'exploitation level' give
  the percentage of stocks relative to the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Regarding sustainability, the aim is to increase the proportion of stocks fished at or below the fishing mortality target FMSY, and reduce to zero the number of stocks of unknown status
  relative to FMSY.  
  
  Series on 'biologically sustainable status' show trends in the spawning stock biomass of stocks of UK interest with respect to safe biological limits. Safe biological limits are where the biomass is above the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield
  (MSY Btrigger). Regarding sustainability, the aim is to increase the proportion of stocks with SSB at or above MSY Btrigger and reduce to zero the number of stocks that have unknown status relative to MSY reference points.

  MSY - Maximum Sustainable Yield
  
  FMSY - Maximum rate of fishing mortality (the proportion of a fish stock caught and removed
  by fishing) that will result (usually after a long period of time) in a population size  that enables a fish stock to deliver the maximum sustainable yield.
  MSY Btrigger - The biomass (body-weight of all fish) of a fish stock at which that stock can deliver Maximum Sustainable Yield.
  
  Proportion of fishstocks that are fully or not fully exploited - the percentage of stocks fished at or below the level capable of producing Maximum
  Sustainable Yield (FMSY)
  
  Proportion of fish stocks that are overexploited - the percentage of stocks fished above the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (FMSY)
  
  Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels (not overexploited) - the
  percentage of stocks with biomass *above* the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY Btrigger).
  
  Proportion of fish stocks not within biologically sustainable levels (overexploited) - the percentage of stocks with biomass *below* the level capable of producing
  Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY Btrigger).

data_footnote: Based on 57 stocks for which data are available, derived from stock assessment reports.  For series regarding biomass remaining the final year will typically show an increase in ‘unknown’ status due to the cycle by which updates are made to stock assessments.

  The indicator follows the improved methodology published in 2018 and is not directly comparable with data previously shown here. The method has  changed following developments for the UK national good environmental status indicators for commercial fish and shellfish stocks.<p> All stock
  data are derived from ICES advice except for whiting (Merlangius merlangus) in Division 6.a (West of Scotland), where estimates are derived from the ICES 2019 Report of the Working Group on Celtic Seas Ecoregion (WGCSE), ICES Scientific Reports (<a
  href="http://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.4982">Volume 1, Issue 29</a>).<p>Please see  <a href="https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-b2-sustainable-fisheries/#downloads">UK Biodiversity Indicators 2020 - B2. Sustainable fisheries</a> for analysis, and further information on the fish stocks
  included in the measure. Technical details can also be found in the <a href="https://hub.jncc.gov.uk/assets/fd9c66ae-52c8-4e70-8253-6d6a1d23901e">UKBI 2020 B2 - Technical Background Document B2 (xlsx)</a>. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been
  identified in collaboration with topic experts.

#### See the [JNCC indicator page](http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4244) for more information on sustainable fishing. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. The indicator comprises measures of both stocks harvested and biomass remaining.   
  
When the percentage of fish stocks harvested above the level capable of producing MSY decreases, the sustainability of fish stocks can be said to have improved.  
  
When the percentage of fish stocks with biomass above levels that maintain full reproductive capacity (MSY Btrigger) increases, the sustainability of fish stocks can be said to have improved. This is the trend between 2006 and 2013.
