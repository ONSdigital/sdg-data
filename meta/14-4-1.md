  14.4 By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can
  produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics
indicator: 14.4.1
indicator_name: 14.4.1 Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
national_indicator_available: Percentage of marine fish (quota) stocks of UK interest; A) that are harvested sustainably (Pressure); B) with biomass at levels that maintain full reproductive capacity (State)
national_indicator_description: >-
  The indicator comprises of two measures – the percentage of fish stocks in seas around the UK that are harvested sustainably; and those at full reproductive capacity. It is based on a group of 20 species in 57 stocks for which there are reliable estimates of fishing mortality and
  spawning biomass, together with MSY reference points for fishing mortality and biomass that allow the sustainability of the stocks to be evaluated. The indicator stocks include a range of local and widely distributed species of major importance to the UK fishing industry. The measures
  are assessed as follows – A) an evaluation of the temporal trends in the exploitation level of stocks of UK interest with respect to the fishing mortality target FMSY. The aim is to increase the proportion of stocks fished at or below FMSY and reduce to zero the number of stocks of
  unknown status relative to FMSY. B) an evaluation of the temporal trends in the spawning stock biomass (SSB) of stocks of UK interest with respect to safe biological limits. The aim is to increase the proportion of stocks with SSB at or above MSY Btrigger and reduce to zero the number of
  stocks that have unknown status relative to MSY reference points.

  The indicator comprises two measures assessed separately - A) the percentage of stocks fished at or below the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (FMSY); and B) the percentage of stocks with biomass above the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY
  Btigger).
reporting_status: complete
data_non_statistical: false
data_footnote: Based on 57 stocks for which data are available, derived from stock assessment reports.  For spawning stock biomass (SSB) the final year will typically show an increase in ‘unknown’ status due to the cycle by which updates are made to stock assessments.
