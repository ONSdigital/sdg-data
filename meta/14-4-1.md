national_indicator_description: >-
  The indicator comprises two broad measures – the percentage of fish stocks in seas around the UK that are i) harvested sustainably (series 1 to 3), and ii) at full reproductive capacity (series 4 to 6).    
    
  Measures are based on a group of 20 species in 57 stocks for which there
  are reliable estimates that allow the sustainability of the stocks to be evaluated. The indicator stocks include a range of local and widely distributed species of major importance to the UK fishing industry.  14% of the stocks within the dataset are interpreted to be straddling stocks
  (see Definitions field). Therefore these data do not fully follow UN specifications for this indicator.     
    
  Series on 'exploitation level' (series 1 to 3) give the percentage of stocks relative to the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Regarding
  sustainability, the aim is to increase the proportion of stocks fished at or below the fishing mortality target FMSY, and reduce to zero the number of stocks of unknown status relative to FMSY.     
       
  Series on 'biologically sustainable status' (series 4 to 6) show trends in the
  spawning stock biomass of stocks of UK interest with respect to safe biological limits. Safe biological limits are where the biomass is above the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY Btrigger). Regarding sustainability, the aim is to increase the proportion of stocks
  with SSB at or above MSY Btrigger and reduce to zero the number of stocks that have unknown status relative to MSY reference points.

  MSY - Maximum Sustainable Yield.  
    
  FMSY - Maximum rate of fishing mortality (the proportion of a fish stock caught and removed
  by fishing) that will result (usually after a long period of time) in a population size  that enables a fish stock to deliver the maximum sustainable
  yield.  
    
  MSY Btrigger - The biomass (body-weight of all fish) of a fish stock at which that stock can deliver Maximum Sustainable Yield.  
    
  Proportion of fish stocks that are not overexploited - The percentage of stocks fished at or below the level capable of producing
  Maximum Sustainable Yield (FMSY). This series combines both 'proportion of fish stocks fully exploited' and 'proportion of fish stocks not fully exploited'.  
    
  Proportion of fish stocks that are overexploited - the percentage of stocks fished above the level capable of producing
  Maximum Sustainable Yield (FMSY).  
    
  Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels (not overexploited) - the percentage of stocks with biomass *above* the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY Btrigger).  
    
  Proportion of fish stocks not
  within biologically sustainable levels (overexploited) - the percentage of stocks with biomass *below* the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY Btrigger).    
      
  Straddling stocks - Straddling stocks are found to move across boundaries between EEZ waters or
  between EEZ and high seas (e.g. tuna stocks), and that are caught by multiple countries.

data_footnote: >-
  Based on 57 stocks for which data are available, derived from stock assessment reports.  For series regarding biomass remaining (series 4 to 6) the final year will typically show an increase in ‘unknown’ status due to the cycle by which updates are made to stock assessments.

  <p>The indicator follows improved methodology published in 2018 and is not directly comparable with data  shown here previously. The method changed following developments for the UK national good environmental status indicators for commercial fish and shellfish stocks. </p><p>All stock
  data are derived from ICES advice except for whiting (Merlangius merlangus) in Division 6.a (West of Scotland), where estimates are derived from the ICES 2019 Report of the Working Group on Celtic Seas Ecoregion (WGCSE), ICES Scientific Reports (<a
  href="http://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.4982">Volume 1, Issue 29</a>).</p><p>Please see <a href="https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-b2-sustainable-fisheries/#downloads">UK Biodiversity Indicators 2020 - B2. Sustainable fisheries</a> for analysis, and further information on the fish stocks
  included in the measure. Technical details can also be found in the <a href="https://hub.jncc.gov.uk/assets/fd9c66ae-52c8-4e70-8253-6d6a1d23901e">UKBI 2020 B2 - Technical Background Document B2 (xlsx)<a/>.  See the <a href="http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-4244">JNCC indicator page</a> for
  more information on sustainable fishing.</p><p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic
  experts.
