  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the main measure of the size of the economy, representing the total value of all final goods and services produced in a defined time period. The ONS has published <a
  href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/whatisgdp/2016-11-21">What is GDP?</a> and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/gdpandme/2017-03-20">GDP and me</a> to explain what GDP is and how it relates to everyday life.
computation_calculations: >-
  Real GDP per employed person = (GDP at constant prices / Total number of employed persons) where the numerator and denominator refer to the same reference period, for example, the same calendar year. If we call the real GDP per employed person “LabProd”, then the annual growth rate of
  real GDP per employed person is calculated as ((LabProd in year n – LabProd in year n-1) / LabProd in year n-1) * 100.
