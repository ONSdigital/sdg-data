  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - It is the main measure of national output, representing the total value of all final goods and services produced in a particular economy (that is, the dollar value of all goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a given year). According to
  the System of National Accounts (SNA), “GDP is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on products, less subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of output … GDP is also equal to the sum of the final
  uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at purchasers’ prices, less the value of imports of goods and services GDP is also equal to the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units.” Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - The real GDP
  refers to the GDP calculated at constant prices, that is, the volume level of GDP, excluding the effect of inflation and favouring comparisons of quantities beyond price changes. Constant price estimates of GDP are calculated by expressing values in terms of a base period. In theory, the
  price and quantity components of a value are identified and the price in the base period is substituted for that in the current period. Employed persons - Persons of working age (usually defined as persons aged 15 and above) who, during a short reference period such as a day or a week,
  (i) did some work (even for just one hour) for pay, profit or family gain, in cash or in kind; or (ii) were attached to a job or had an enterprise from which they were ‘temporarily’ absent during this period (for such reasons as illness, maternity, parental leave, holiday, training,
  industrial dispute).

  Real GDP per employed person = (GDP at constant prices / Total number of employed persons) where the numerator and denominator refer to the same reference period, for example, the same calendar year. If we call the real GDP per employed person “LabProd”, then the annual growth rate of
  real GDP per employed person is calculated as follows - Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person = ((LabProd in year n – LabProd in year n-1) / LabProd in year n-1) * 100.
