  2.3 By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial
  services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment
indicator: 2.3.1
indicator_name: 2.3.1 Volume of production per labour unit by classes of farming/pastoral/forestry enterprise size
national_indicator_available: Total factor and labour productivity of the UK agriculture industry
national_indicator_description: Total factor productivity is a key measure of the economic performance of agriculture and an important driver of farm incomes. It represents how efficiently the agricultural industry uses the resources that are available to turn inputs into outputs.

  All outputs - The volume of all outputs sold off the farm. This excludes transactions within the industry. All inputs - The volume of goods and services purchased and consumed. This excludes transactions within the industry. Total factor productivity - How efficiently all inputs are
  turned into outputs. Derived by dividing all outputs by all inputs. Partial productivity - How efficiently intermediate consumption, capital, labour or land is transformed into outputs. Derived by dividing all outputs by each factor.

  Outputs and inputs are adjusted for quality by weighting the volumes by price. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been
  identified in collaboration with topic experts.

Partial productivity shows the impact key inputs have on productivity. It measures total outputs against a part of the inputs. The chart below clearly shows that labour has to date been the key input in driving productivity gains. Productivity by labour shows a steady increase over the whole period. Labour volumes are now approximately half of what they were in 1973. However over the last few years growth in labour productivity is due to increased output rather than a reduction in labour volume. <br><br>Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[2.3.1 Volume of production per labour unit by classes of farming/pastoral/forestry enterprise size (CSV 12.611 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/2-3-1.csv)
