**Non-statistical indicator**

The UK has various policies and strategy plans in place to support sustainable consumption and production. For example - 

[25 year environment plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan) - This plan sets out how resources from nature are to be used more sustainably and effectively in England.   

[Resources and waste strategy for England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/resources-and-waste-strategy-for-england) - This strategy sets out plans to preserve material resources by minimising waste, promoting resource efficiency and moving towards a circular economy in England.

[Environment (Wales) Act 2016](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2016/3/contents) - This Act introduces a number of measures to manage Wales’ natural resources. It allows Wales’ natural resources to be managed at both a national and local level through different frameworks such as the [Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2015/2/contents/enacted) and [Planning (Wales) Act 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/anaw/2015/4/contents/enacted).

[Towards zero waste - our waste strategy](https://gov.wales/towards-zero-waste-our-waste-strategy) - This is Wales’ long term aim for resource efficiency and waste management. 

[Making Things Last - a circular economy strategy for Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/publications/making-things-last-circular-economy-strategy-scotland/) - This strategy sets out priorities for moving towards a more circular economy where products and materials are kept in high value use for as long as possible. It builds on Scotland's progress in the zero waste and resource efficiency agendas.
