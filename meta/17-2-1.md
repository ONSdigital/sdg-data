  <p>Official Development Assistance (ODA) is provided according to the standardised definitions and methodologies of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC). ODA is defined as resource flows to developing countries and
  multilateral organisations, which are provided by official agencies (e.g. the UK Government) or their executive agencies, where each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective and is concessional in
  character. More information on DAC and ODA can be found on the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">OECD website</a>. </p> <p>For the current list of countries
  eligible for ODA, as well as which countries classify as least developed, visit the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/daclist.htm">OECD website</a> </p><p>Bilateral flows are supplied by a donor country directly to a
  developing country. Multilateral flows represent funding from national governments to multilateral
  organisations, which is pooled with other donors’ funding and disbursed as part of the core budget of the multilateral organisation</p> <p>GNI refers to Gross National Income.</p><p>LDCs
  refers to Least Developed Countries </p>
computation_calculations: >-
  <p>Headline ODA:GNI ratio is available in calculated format (with rounding) from Table C1 in Source 2. Least developed countries ODA:GNI ratio is calculated using only bilateral ODA for least developed countries. There is an additional disaggregation using the sum of bilateral and
  imputed multilateral shares ODA (imputed multilateral shares are not published after 2018) (see Source 1). Calculation is performed as (ODA/GNI) * 100.</p> <p>GNI figures are obtained from Source 3.</p>
