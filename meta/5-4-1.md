  <p>Informal carers - the Family Resources Survey (FRS) defines all those giving help on an informal basis (that is, not as part of a paid job) as informal carers. This definition is consistent with the <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/unpaid-care/">Government
  Statistical Service (GSS) harmonised “core” definition</a>. Professional carers can also be informal carers if giving help outside of work. What should be counted as care is not prescriptively defined but includes activities such as going shopping for someone and helping with paperwork.
  Those in receipt of care may be receiving either formal or informal care or a mixture of both.</p>

  <p> 1) Data collection for 2020/21 was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Please see the<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2020-to-2021/family-resources-survey-background-information-and-methodology"> Family Resources Survey (FRS)
  Information and Methodology </a> for the specific adjustments that have been made in light of the COVID impacts on the sample.</p> <p> 2) For the series "Proportion of population who are informal carers" the base population of the percentage is the total adult population, for instance
  "in 2020/21, 6 percent of the total adult population were informal carers". For the series "Proportion of informal carers by characteristics" the base population of the percentage is all informal carers, for instance "in 2020/21, of all informal carers, 53 percent were in
  employment".</p><p> 3) There are some intentional breaks in the time-series for younger age groups in the 'Proportion of informal carers by characteristics' as for some years there are missing data due to negligible estimates (populations of less than 0.5 per cent, or 0.1 million). For
  the years 2014/15 and 2015/16 the youngest age category (0-15 years old) is split into two age categories.</p>
