  <p> Informal carers - the FRS defines all those giving help on an informal basis (that is, not as part of a paid job) as informal carers.  This definition is consistent with the <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/unpaid-care/"> Government Statistical Service (GSS)
  harmonised “core” definition </a>. Professional carers can also be informal carers if giving help outside of work. What should be counted as care is not prescriptively defined but includes activities such as going shopping for someone and helping with paperwork. Those in receipt of care
  may be receiving either formal or informal care or a mixture of both.</p>
