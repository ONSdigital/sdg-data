  The OECD Frascati Manual provides the relevant definitions for research and experimental development, gross domestic expenditure on R&D and researchers. Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of
  knowledge - including knowledge of humankind, culture and society -  and to devise new applications of available knowledge. Intramural expenditures are all expenditures for R&D performed within a statistical unit or sector of the economy during a specific period, whatever the source of
  funds. Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems and also in the management of the projects concerned.

  Prior to 2011 PNP data were estimated. From 2011 data has been collected from a biennial survey with non-survey years being estimated using data from survey years. New higher education financial reporting standards starting on or after 1 January 2015 have resulted in significant changes
  in how financial performance is reported. This presents difficulties in comparing results from 2015 onwards with historical trends.
