  Foreign direct investment (FDI) is cross-border investment made with the objective of establishing a lasting interest in the host economy. The FDI part of this indicator focuses on inflows (inward FDI), which is the direct investments in the UK from non-resident companies. Official
  development assistance (ODA) is defined by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) as â€œgovernment aid that promotes and specifically targets the economic development and welfare of developing countries". GNI refers to Gross National Income.
computation_calculations: >-
  The ODA:GNI ratio (as a percentage) is provided in a calculated format from the original publication in Table C1 from Source 1 (with rounding). The FDI:GNI ratio (as a percentage) is calculated using the FDI inflows from Source 2 and the UK GNI figures from Source 3 as (FDI/GNI) x 100.
  The GNI numbers are also available from historic FCDO publications in Table 1 (see Source 1)
