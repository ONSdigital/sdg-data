  Countries classified as high-income with a Gross National Income (GNI) of more than US$ 12,746 - per capita are assumed to have made a complete transition to using clean fuels and technologies as the primary domestic energy source for cooking and the primary reliance on polluting
  (unclean) fuels and technologies use is reported to be less than 5% and assumed as zero for regional and global estimates.
