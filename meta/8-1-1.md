  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the monetary value of final goods and services—that is, those that are bought by the final user—produced in an economic territory country in a given period of time (say a quarter or a year). It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation
  of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. GDP can be measured using the expenditure approach as the sum of expenditure on final consumption plus gross capital formation plus exports less imports, the production approach as the value of output less
  intermediate consumption plus any taxes less subsidies on products not already included in the value of output, or the income approach as compensation of employees plus gross operating surplus plus gross mixed incomes plus taxes less subsidies on both production and imports.
