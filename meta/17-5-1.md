  To be included in the number of countries that have adopted and implemented investment promotion
regimes, the existence of at least one type of promotion instrument (eg an investment guarantee scheme) would be sufficient. The Manufacturing Africa programme fulfills this requirement.<p>
  Manufacturing Africa, formerly the Invest Africa programme, is a £100 million initiative that aims to increase foreign direct investment (FDI) into manufacturing in Africa. It does so by working with developing-country governments, international investors, buyers, and financiers –
  including from the UK. Over 10 years the programme will help create 90,000 jobs and generate £1.2 billion of new FDI. It will support developing countries to industrialise, produce higher value-added goods, and thereby transform their economies, creating high quality job opportunities
  for the poor. <br> <br>  The programme operates in 7 countries – this currently includes Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and Cote D’Ivoire. This feeds into the [Global Britain agenda](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/global-britain-delivering-on-our-
  international-ambition#history) – building wider and deeper global markets that will benefit the UK. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
