  <p> Homicide figures have been compiled from the Homicide Index recorded by the Home Office, which contains detailed record-level information about each homicide recorded by police in England and Wales. The Homicide Index data are based on the year when the offence was recorded as a
  crime, not when the offence took place or when the case was heard in court. While in the vast majority of cases the offence will be recorded in the same year as it took place, this is not always the case. Caution is therefore needed when looking at longer-term homicide trends. </p><p>
  The Homicide Index is continually updated with revised information from the police as investigations continue and as cases are heard by the courts. For further information, see the <a href=
  "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales">user guide for the Homicide Index</a>.</p><p>Home Office statisticians and Police Forces have undertaken a review of all historical homicide data to update
  court outcomes and suspect data, this means totals shown in this table will not match previously published figures. Therefore, previous time series by region and police force area are not available.</p><p> These figures are revised  from the earliest period and therefore only a 10 year
  period is available during each update. </p><p> As at  6 December 2022; figures are subject to revision as cases are dealt with by the police and by the courts, or as further information becomes available. </p><p> Home Office statisticians and police forces have undertaken a review of
  homicide data for year ending March 2019 and year ending March 2020 to update suspect data and cancelled crimes. Totals shown in this table will not match previously published figures. </p><p>Totals may not sum as numbers include some victims with unknown age or sex.</p>  Data follows
  the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
