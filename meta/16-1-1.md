  Homicide figures have been compiled from the Homicide Index recorded by the Home Office, which contains detailed record-level information about each homicide recorded by police in England and Wales. The Homicide Index data are based on the year when the offence was recorded as a crime,
  not when the offence took place or when the case was heard in court. While in the vast majority of cases the offence will be recorded in the same year as it took place, this is not always the case. Caution is therefore needed when looking at longer-term homicide trends.
computation_calculations: No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.
