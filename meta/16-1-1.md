  Homicide figures have been compiled from the Homicide Index recorded by the Home Office, which contains detailed record-level information about each homicide recorded by police in England and Wales. Homicide Index data are based on the year when the offence was recorded as a crime, not
  when the offence took place or when the case was heard in court. While in the vast majority of cases the offence will be recorded in the same year as it took place, this is not always the case. Caution is therefore needed when looking at longer-term homicide trends.

  1. The period April to March is being used to report annual data. 2. As at 4 December 2018, figures are subject to revision as cases are dealt with by the police and the courts, or as further information becomes available. 3. Figures for 2011/12, 2014/15 and 2015/16 include 1 victim with
  unknown gender. 4. Data for City of London have been suppressed due to the small population size of the police force area.
