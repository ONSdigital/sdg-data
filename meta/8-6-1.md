  Labour Force Survey responses have been (LFS) <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/impactofreweightingonlabourforcesurveykeyindicatorsuk/2020">reweighted to new populations</a> derived using growth rates from HM
  Revenue and Customs (HMRC) Real Time Information (RTI), to allow for different trends during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. the reweighting will give improved estimates of both rates and levels for estimates from Q1 2020 onwards. However, during the implementation of this weighting
  methodology a small error was encountered resulting in a slight overestimation of the non-UK population by approximately 0.5%. This represents less than half the size of the sampling variability. The impact on LFS economic activity estimates at national level is mostly below 0.1% and the
  impact on rates is less than 0.02 percentage points.
