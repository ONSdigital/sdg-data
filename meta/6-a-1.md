target: 6.a By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies
indicator: 6.a.1
indicator_name: 6.a.1 Amount of water- and sanitation-related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan
national_indicator_available: Net amount of water and sanitation related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan
national_indicator_description: >-
  The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) is a quantifiable measurement as a proxy for “international cooperation and capacity development support” in financial terms. It is essential to be able to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is
  included in the government budget to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned with national governments while highlighting total water and sanitation ODA disbursements to developing countries over time.

  Development Assistance Committee (DAC) - A unique international forum of many of the largest funders of aid, including 30 DAC Members. The World Bank, IMF and UNDP participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA) - The DAC defines ODA as “those flows to countries and
  territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and
  welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent) (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). Other
  official flows (OOF) - Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not
  sufficiently concessional (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf - Para 24). Bilateral Aid -  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled
  through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid -  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations.
  Purpose Codes - The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes
  used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm). “International cooperation and capacity-building support” implies aid (most of it quantifiable) in the form of grants or loans by external support agencies. The amount of water and
  sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) can be used as a proxy for this, captured by OECD Creditor Reporting  System (CRS). ODA is defined as flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as
  the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 per cent (using a fixed 10 per cent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (“bilateral ODA”)
  and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts, from a recipient perspective, comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export credit agencies—with the pure purpose of export promotion—is excluded
  (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). “Developing countries” refer to countries, which are eligible to receive official development assistance (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm). This limits the scope of reporting to those
  countries receiving water and sanitation ODA, and the number of such countries is expected to decrease going forward. Water and sanitation-related activities and programmes include those for water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (targets 6.1, 6.2), wastewater and water quality
  (6.3), water efficiency (6.4), water resource management (6.5), and water-related ecosystems (6.6). As per target 6.a wording, it includes activities and programmes for water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies. A government
  coordinated spending plan is defined as a financing plan/budget for the water and sanitation sector, clearly assessing the available sources of finance and strategies for financing future needs.

  The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes, bilateral and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of aid codes. The codes used to measure  water- and sanitation-
  related official development assistance that is part of a government-coordinated spending plan sit under DAC 5 CODE 140.
