  The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) is a quantifiable measurement as a proxy for “international cooperation and capacity development support” in financial terms. It is essential to be able to assess ODA in proportion with how much of it is
  included in the government budget to gain a better understanding of whether donors are aligned with national governments while highlighting total water and sanitation ODA disbursements to developing countries over time.

  <p>Official Development Assistance (ODA) - Resource flows to developing countries and multilateral organisations provided by official agencies (e.g. the UK Government) or their executive agencies. Each transaction is administered for the promotion of the economic development and welfare
  of developing countries and is concessional in character. More information on ODA can be found on the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">OECD website</a>. ODA
  recipients are broken down in groups according to their Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.<p>Country income classification - The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of countries eligible to receive ODA is based on Gross National Income per capita as published by the <a
  href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD">World Bank</a>. All low and middle income countries are included, with the exception of G8 members, EU members, and countries with a firm date for entry into the EU. The list also includes all Least Developed Countries (LDCs) as
  defined by the <a href = "https://www.un.org/ohrlls/content/least-developed-countries%20">United Nations (UN)</a>.<p>LDCs - Least Developed Countries<p>LMICs - Lower-middle Income Countries<p>UMICs - Upper Middle Income Countries<p>Other LICs - Other Low Income Countries<p>Undefined -

  The net ODA obtained from the UK  Statistics on International Development (SID) is summed around appropriate aid description Sector Purpose codes (CRS codes). The codes correspond to all 14000-series for the water supply and sanitation sector and CRS code 31140 for agricultural water
  resources. The net ODA across these CRS codes is summed for the headline UK data. These sums are broken down into the different country income classifications outlined in the definitions. The CRS code field and other relevant disaggregations are available from the Data Underlying SID
  spreadsheets linked in Source 1.
