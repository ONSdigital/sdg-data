  Formal learning is defined as learning that is intended to lead to a nationally recognised qualification. For example, a degree or NVQ. Non-formal learning is defined a course or taught class that does not lead to a nationally recognised qualification. For example, a first aid course.
  The Adult Education Survey uses a non-harmonised definition of disability. In the survey a respondent’s disability status was classified as either ‘Currently disabled and/or work-limiting disabled’ or ‘Not disabled’. Disabled (current disability) includes those who have a long-term
  disability which substantially limits their day-to-day activities. Work-limiting disabled includes those who have a long-term disability which affects the kind or amount of work they might do.
