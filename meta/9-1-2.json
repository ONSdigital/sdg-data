The International Transport Forum (ITF) collects data on transport (rail and road) statistics on annual basis from all its Member countries. Data are collected from Transport Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its Statistics Division have established standard methodologies and definitions to collect and report traffic (passenger and freight volume) data related to air transport. These standards and methodologies have been adopted by the 191 Member States of ICAO and also by the Industry stakeholders i.e. air carriers and airports. The data of ICAO is used by States and also the World Bank for its development indicators. ICAO uses Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport. Precise definition of all different concepts and metadata related to Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport. Approved by the ICAO Statistics Division and Member States can be found at the ICAO website - http://www.icao.int/sustainability/pages/eap-sta-excel.aspx/.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Air passenger and air freight volumes (in thousands)","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":null,"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for Transport (DfT)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2007,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/avi01-traffic-passenger-numbers-mode-of-travel-to-airport","source_url_text_1":"Aviation statistics - data tables (AVI)","source_release_date_1":43440,"source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_contact_1":"aviation.stats@dft.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"AVI0102 - Air traffic by type of service, operator and airport (ODS, 42.6KB)","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"09-01-02","comments_limitations":"This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
