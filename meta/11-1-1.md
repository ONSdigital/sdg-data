  For a dwelling to be considered ‘decent’ under the Decent Homes Standard it must - meet the statutory minimum standard for housing as set out in the <a href='https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/9425/150940.pdf'>Housing Health
  and Safety Rating System (HHSRS)</a>, provide a reasonable degree of thermal comfort (related to insulation and heating efficiency), be in a reasonable state of repair (related to the age and condition of a range of building components including walls, roofs, windows, doors, chimneys,
  electrics and heating systems) and have reasonably modern facilities and services (related to the age, size and layout/location of the kitchen, bathroom and WC and any common areas for blocks of flats, and to noise insulation).

  Household - One person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accomodation as their only or main residence, and (for a group) share cooking facilities and share a living room or sitting room or dining area. Dwelling - A unit of accommodation which may comprise one or
  more household spaces (a household space is the accomodation used or available for use by an individual household). A dwelling can be classified as shared or unshared. For the full definitions of Dwellings and Households please see the <a

  1) Data that is not reported for any categories is due to small sample size resulting in unreliable estimates. The data are either for dwellings or households, which can be selected under units. The differences between dwellings and households can be seen under 'Definitions'. 2) The
  sample size for workless households variable excludes cases where no-one in the households is working age. 3) The sample size for the long-term illness or disability variable excludes unknown cases. 4) 'HHSRS' refers to the housing health and safety rating system.

  Dwellings failing the minimum standard are those posing a Category 1 hazard under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS).  From 2008 the survey is able to estimate the presence of 26 of the 29 HHSRS hazards. However to maintain consistency and avoid a break in the time
  series from 2006, Decent Homes estimates continue to be based on 15 hazards for the 'minimum standard' criterion. Estimates for the HHSRS tables (DA4101-3) are based on the 26 hazards covered by the survey.  For more information see  <a
  href='https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7812/138355.pdf'>A Decent Home -Definition and guidance for implementation</a>. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to
  identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
