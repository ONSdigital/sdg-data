  state of repair (related to the age and condition of a range of building components including walls, roofs, windows, doors, chimneys, electrics and heating systems) and have reasonably modern facilities and services (related to the age, size and layout/location of the kitchen, bathroom
  and WC and any common areas for blocks of flats, and to noise insulation). Although the 'Decent Homes Standard' does not directly address all 7 of the criteria set out in the UN metadata for the definition of 'Inadequate Housing' it provides detailed information regarding the
  'habitability' aspect of the criteria and as a result is classified as a proxy.<p/>

  <p>Household - One person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accomodation as their only or main residence, and (for a group) share cooking facilities and share a living room or sitting room or dining area. Dwelling - A unit of accommodation which may comprise one
  or more household spaces (a household space is the accomodation used or available for use by an individual household). A dwelling can be classified as shared or unshared. For the full definitions of Dwellings and Households please see the <a (PDF 476 KB)

  store/measuring-disability-for-the-equality-act-2010/">(GSS) harmonised "core" definition</a> identifies a person as disabled if they have a physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more. It must reduce their ability to carry-out
  day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that
  disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain. In this case a disabled household includes those that
  report any household member having a long-term illness or disability. </p><p> 'HHSRS' refers to the housing health and safety rating system.<p/><p> Household income refers to the combined income and savings of the household reference person and any partner.<p/>

  <p>Dwellings failing the minimum standard are those posing a Category 1 hazard under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS).  From 2008 the survey is able to estimate the presence of 26 of the 29 HHSRS hazards. However to maintain consistency and avoid a break in the time
  series from 2006, Decent Homes estimates continue to be based on 15 hazards for the 'minimum standard' criterion. Estimates for the HHSRS tables (DA4101-3) are based on the 26 hazards covered by the survey.  For more information see <a(PDF 209 KB)

  identified in collaboration with topic experts.
