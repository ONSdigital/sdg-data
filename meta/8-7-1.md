  There is no one data source that accurately quantifies the number of child victims in the UK. The National Referral Mechanism (NRM) currently provides the best measure of potential victims, although is known to be an undercount. Please see the Sourcing data on child victims of modern
  slavery, UK - progress report for details on the process of choosing to use NRM data. https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/sourcingdataonchildvictimsofmodernslaveryukprogressreport/2022-03-29. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the
  UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
