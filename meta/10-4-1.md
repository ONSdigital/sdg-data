The methodology used to compile this data differs from the labour share published in the [Labour Productivity national statistic release](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/bulletins/labourproductivity/octobertodecember2018), because it excludes the impact of the self-employed.  Further information can be found in the [Labour productivity, UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/bulletins/labourproductivity/octobertodecember2018) release and this [article](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/methodologies/estimatingtheimpactoftheselfemployedinthelabourshare).<br><br>Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[10.4.1 Labour share of GDP, comprising wages and social protection transfers (CSV 0.486 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/10-4-1.csv)
