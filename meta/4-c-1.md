  Data is based on state funded public schools. All public schools include - nursery, primary, secondary, special and centrally employed schools. The proportion of qualified teachers includes both full and part time teachers. An unqualified teacher is either a trainee working towards
  qualified teacher status (QTS); an overseas trained teacher who has not exceeded the four years they are allowed to teach without having QTS; or an instructor who has a particular skill who can be employed for so long as a qualified teacher is not available.   This indicator is being
  used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
