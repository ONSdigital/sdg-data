  <p> Data is based on state-funded schools which includes - nursery, primary, secondary, special and centrally employed schools. </p> <p> The proportion of qualified teachers includes both full and part time teachers. An unqualified teacher is either a trainee working towards qualified
  teacher status (QTS); an overseas trained teacher who has not exceeded the four years they are allowed to teach without having QTS; or an instructor who has a particular skill who can be employed for so long as a qualified teacher is not available. </p> <p> More detailed information is
  available in the source publication. </p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic
  experts.
