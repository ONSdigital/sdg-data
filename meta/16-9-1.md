The UK has comprehensive birth registration systems in place. It is a legal requirement to register a birth in the UK within 42 days. There is no direct measure of number of children who are unregistered. As registration is comprehensive, a figure of 100% is used.

Information provided at birth registration is used to produce birth statistics, which are published separately for each of the UK countries. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publish [birth statistics for England and Wales](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths). For more information, see the [user guide to birth statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/methodologies/userguidetobirthstatistics#issues-affecting-the-quality-of-birth-registration-data). National Records of Scotland publish [birth statistics for Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/births) and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research agency (NISRA) publish [birth statistics for Northern Ireland](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/births-deaths-and-marriages/births). A summary of birth statistics for the UK and constituent countries is published in the [Vital statistics in the UK - births, deaths and marriages](http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/vitalstatisticspopulationandhealthreferencetables) tables.
