  Estimates do not include or take account of marriages occurring abroad either before migrating to England and Wales or whilst as a resident of England and Wales. Estimates are based on the population estimates by marital status, specifically the population who are 'Single, never married
  or civil partnered'. Migrants will be included within these population estimates. Estimates try to indicate behaviour by exact age 18 and by exact age 17 and do not take into account; death, divorce or migration which could occur by age 24. For 2014 marriage statistics onwards, ever
  married will include people entering into a marriage with either an opposite sex or a same sex partner. Same sex couples converting their civil partnership into a marriage will be included with ever married because previous marital status is unknown; therefore within this table we are
  assuming a previous marital status (before civil partnership) of single, never married or civil partnered.   This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.
  This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
