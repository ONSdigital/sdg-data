  <p>Internet users - adults (aged 16 and over) who have used the internet within the last 3 months.</p><p>Disability Status - The <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/measuring-disability-for-the-equality-act-2010/">(GSS) harmonised "core" definition</a> identifies a
  person as disabled if they have a physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more. It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not
  reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in
  legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>

data_footnote: >-
  1. The period January to March is being used to report annual data. 2. Percentages sum to less than 100 due to 'don't know' responses. 3. Figures for the lower geographic areas are based on small sample sizes and are therefore subject to a greater degree of sampling variability, so
  should be treated with caution.
