**Non-statistical indicator**

Education in the United Kingdom is devolved, and so there is some variance in the approach to Education for Sustainable Development. We have identified relevant links to official curriculums â€“

<strong>England</strong>

There is no statutory requirement for Sustainable Development Education in the [English National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum). However, Sustainable Development education forms part of a range of subjects in the National Curriculum. There are also a number of government funded programmes that schools and pupils can choose to participate in to enhance their learning of sustainable development.

<strong>Northern Ireland</strong>

[Education For Sustainable Development](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2007/46/introduction/made) is part of the required minimum content for Key Stage 3. 

<strong>Scotland</strong>

[Learning for Sustainability](https://education.gov.scot/education-scotland/scottish-education-system/policy-for-scottish-education/policy-drivers/learning-for-sustainability) is a cross-curricular approach, that weaves together global citizenship, sustainable development education and outdoor learning.

<strong>Wales</strong>

[Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship](https://hwb.gov.wales/storage/eaf467e6-30fe-45c9-93ef-cb30f31f1c90/common-understanding-for-school.pdf) provides learners, at all stages of education, an understanding of the broad themes of Sustainable Development.
