**Non-statistical indicator**

This, or part of this, indicator is classified as Tier 3 and therefore no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available, but methodology or standards are being (or will be) developed or tested.

Education in the UK is devolved, and so there is some variance in the approach to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). We have therefore identified relevant policy/legislation by country, as well as the official curriculum and some supporting case studies.
