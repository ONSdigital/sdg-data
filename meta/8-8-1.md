computation_units: Rate per 100,000 workers
computation_definitions: Occupational injury - Any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident.
  Fatal occupational injury  - An occupational injury leading to death within one year of the day of the occupational accident. 
available_disaggregations: <p>Detailed breakdowns of fatal injury rates by country/region, age and sex are presented for the last five-years only.</p><p>Non-fatal injury rates are not provided for sub-groups where  sample numbers are too small to provide reliable estimates.</p>
computation_calculations: >-
  Incidence rates are calculated by dividing the number of workers in the reference group with an injury (fatal or non-fatal) by the employment total.  This is then multiplied by a factor of 100,000 to give a rate per 100,000 workers, in line with international standards.

data_footnote: >-
  1.The rate for the most recent year is a provisional estimate. 2. The rate of fatal injury for some of the detailed groupings are based on small numbers and are susceptible to considerable year-on-year variation.  3. Non-fatal injury estimates are based on the Labour Force Survey and are
  subject to sampling uncertainty. Details, in the form of 95% confidence intervals, can be found in the source data (see 'Sources' tab below). 4. Non-fatal injuries broken down by age, sex, country, English regions, industry sector and occupation are based on averaged rates over a non-
  overlapping 3 year period to enable a large enough sample size. For example, 2001/02 to 2003/04 figures are displayed at the mid-year point (i.e. 2002/03).

other_info: >-
  <p>Data for fatal and non-fatal workplace injuries do not include road traffic accidents. </p><p>Rates for non-fatal injuries are based on self-reported non-fatal injury in the workplace (using the Labour Force Survey). Fatal injury rates are based on the count of fatal injuries
  reportable under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR).  </p><p>Variations in rate between different sub-groups of age, sex and geography may reflect differences in their employment profile.  </p>  This indicator is being used as an
  approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
