indicator: 8.8.1
indicator_name: 8.8.1 Frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries, by sex and migrant status
national_indicator_available: Rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries, by sex
national_indicator_description: Rates of fatal injuries per 100,000 workers (employees and self employees) and rates of self-reported workplace non-fatal injury (per 100,000 workers)
un_designated_tier: Tier II
un_custodian_agency: International Labour Organization (ILO)

national_geographical_coverage: Great Britain
computation_units: Rate per 100,000 workers
computation_definitions: Occupational injury - Any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident.
  Fatal occupational injury  - An occupational injury leading to death within one year of the day of the occupational accident. 
computation_calculations: Incidence rates are based on the number of workers in the reference group during the reference year/total number of employees *100,000

data_non_statistical: false
data_footnote: >-
  1. Rate of fatal injury for the most recent year is a provisional estimate. 2. The rate of fatal injury for some of the detailed groupings are based on small numbers and are susceptible to considerable year-on-year variation. 3. Rates for fatal injuries are only available for areas where
  an incident occurred. 4. Non-fatal injury estimates are based on the Labour Force Survey and are subject to sampling uncertainty. Details, in the form of 95% confidence intervals, can be found in the source data (see 'Sources' tab below). 5. Non-fatal injuries broken down by age, sex,
  country and English regions are based on averaged rates over a non-overlapping 3 year period to enable a large enough sample size. For example, 2000/2001 to 2002/03. Figures are displayed at the mid-year point (e.g. 2001/02). 6. Rates for fatal injuries are only available for areas where
  an incident occurred. 7. Variations in rate between different sub-groups of age, sex and geography may reflect differences in their employment profile.

  Data for fatal and non-fatal workplace injuries do not include road traffic accidents. Rates for non-fatal injuries are based on self-reported non-fatal injury in the workplace (using the Labour Force Survey).    This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
  Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
