  All certified woodland is certified under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) scheme. Some of these woodlands are also certified under the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) scheme. The estimates are based on UK data published by FSC, supplemented by data from
  individual certificates and other sources. Where possible, figures are for the woodland area certified, rather than the land area certified.  Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
