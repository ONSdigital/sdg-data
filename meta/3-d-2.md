  <p>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a type of bacteria found on human skin that can cause infection. S. aureus or staph infections are often treated with antibiotics. Methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a type of staph bacteria that is resistant to certain
  antibiotics. Methicilin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infections (MSSA) are usually treatable with antibiotics.</p><p>Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteraemia is a bloodstream infection caused by E. coli bacteria.</p><p>Cephalosporins are a type of antibiotic used to treat bacterial
  infections such as E. coli bacteraemia. The 3rd generation cephalosporins considered in the series Proportion of E. coli bloodstream infections resistant to antibiotics are - cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefpodoxime and/or ceftriaxone. Tests to one or multiple are taken into account, and the
  most resistant test result retained.</p>
computation_calculations: Proportion of S. aureaus bloodstream infections resistant to antibiotics is calculated as (MRSA infection counts/Total MRSA infection and MSSA infection counts)*100

  <p>Methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are among the most common human fast-growing bacteria causing acute human bloodstream infections. </p><p>For the series Proportion of E.coli bloodstream infections resistant to antibiotics, a higher value
  is indicative of increased 3rd generation cephalosporin resistance. Data are only available for the NHS and private laboratories signed up to report to Public Health Englandâ€™s voluntary surveillance system SGSS antimicrobial testing module.</p> Data follows the UN specification for this
  indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
