  Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in a national economy. Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic extraction (DE) of
  materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials. DMC per capita is calculated as DMC/UK population. DMC per GDP is calculated as DMC/GDP.
computation_calculations: <p>No calculations were performed in the data acquisition for DMC and DMC per capita as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.</p><p>Domestic Material per GDP is calculated as DMC/GDP.</p>

data_footnote: >-
  1. Imports and exports for 'Other' and 'waste for final treatment and disposal' are included in the Domestic Material Consumption estimates. 2. Total material input and consumption for 2016 onwards may be slight underestimates due to small missing data sources on extraction for some
  minor materials. 3. Total figures are based on raw data and therefore may not sum due to rounding.
