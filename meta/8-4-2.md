computation_definitions: >-
  <p>Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in a national economy. Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic extraction (DE) of
  materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials. DMC per capita is calculated as DMC/UK population. DMC per GDP is calculated as DMC/GDP.</p> <p> All reference to tonnes refers to Metric Tonnes. </p>
computation_calculations: >-
  <p>No calculations were performed in the data acquisition for DMC and DMC per capita as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.</p><p>Domestic Material per GDP is calculated as DMC/GDP using a Constant USD conversion.</p><p>The constant USD
  conversion was done using methodology specified by the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/informationnoteonthedacdeflators.htm">OECD</a>.</p> <p>The GBP values for GDP were converted with the USD exchange rate for the
  respective year, and then a deflator with base year 2019 was applied to transform the current USD values to constant 2019 USD values.</p>

data_footnote: >-
  1. Imports and exports for 'Other' and 'waste for final treatment and disposal' are included in the Domestic Material Consumption estimates. 2. Total material input and consumption for 2016 onwards may be slight underestimates due to small missing data sources on extraction for some
  minor materials. 3. Total figures are based on raw data and therefore may not sum due to rounding.
