  Data is provided from the Nomis Mortality Statistics dataset. This dataset provides mortality statistics for England and Wales, broken down by calendar year of registration, age, sex, underlying cause of death  (classified using ICD10, the International Classification of Diseases, 10th
  revision) and area of usual residence of the deceased. Death statistics are compiled from information supplied when deaths are certified and registered as part of civil registration, a legal requirement. Figures represent the number of deaths registered in the calendar year. Figures
  represent deaths which occurred in England and Wales - these include the deaths of individuals whose usual residence was outside England and Wales.

  1. Underlying cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes X30 to X39. 2. Figures are for persons usually resident in England and Wales, based on boundaries as of February 2020. 3. Figures are based on deaths registered,
  rather than deaths occurring between 2001 and 2018.  Figures only include deaths that were registered by 31 Dec 2018. 4. Where rates are based on a count that is less than 3, they have been suppressed to 0. Where they are based on a count less than 10, they are considered unreliable,
  therefore both rates and absolute death numbers have been included in these figures.

source_other_info_1:   Please note the data source contains separate death rates per 100,000 population for England and for Wales, and death rates by cause of death and sex which have not been included here. This is because in some instances the number of deaths are very small (less than 10), meaning the rate
  is statistically unreliable. Therefore, death rates are only included here for combined England and Wales by sex, as there have been enough deaths to increase reliability of these figures. The absolute number of deaths has been reported for all other breakdowns.

  For more information, please see [Mortality Statistics Quality and Methodology Information](http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/qmis/mortalitystatisticsinenglandandwalesqmi). This document contains important information on the strengths and
  limitations of the data, the quality of the output including the accuracy of the data, how it compares with related data, uses and users and how the output was created. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or
  develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
