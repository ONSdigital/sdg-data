target: 7.3 By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency
indicator: 7.3.1
indicator_name: 7.3.1 Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP
national_indicator_available: Reallocated energy use (in Terajoules) in terms of gross value added (GVA) and chained volume measure (CVM)
national_indicator_description: >-
  Units of direct energy used per unit of GVA (CVM), as an indicator of energy efficiency by sector. The Chained Volume Measures are created from the short term measures of output. The majority of indicators in the short term measures are measuring changes in output as a proxy for changes
  in GVA. At the reference year (currently 2015) the values are set equal to current price GVA values.

un_custodian_agency: International Energy Agency (IEA), United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), United Nations' inter-agency mechanism on energy (UN Energy) and the SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework Consortium

computation_units: Terajoules per GBP (£m)
computation_definitions: >-
  Total energy supply, as defined by the International Recommendations for Energy Statistics (IRES), as made up of production plus net imports minus international marine and aviation bunkers plus-stock changes. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the measure of economic output. For
  international comparison purposes, GDP is measured in constant terms at purchasing power parity.
