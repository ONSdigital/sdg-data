national_geographical_coverage: United Kingdom
computation_units: Terajoules per million pounds (TJ/£ million)
computation_definitions: Energy intensity is defined as the energy supplied to the economy per unit value of economic output. 
computation_calculations: Energy intensity is calculated by dividing reallocated energy consumption by Gross Value Added (GVA) in constant prices.

data_footnote: >-
  Energy intensity is calculated by dividing reallocated energy consumption by Gross Value Added (GVA) in constant prices. This is the difference between output and intermediate consumption for any given industry. This means the difference between the value of goods and services produced
  (output) and the cost of raw materials and other inputs which are used up in production (intermediate consumption). Data are in constant prices with 2016 defined as the base year.
