  The International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) organizes jobs into a clearly defined set of groups according to the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. Employed persons are all persons of working age who during a specified brief period, such as one week or one day,
  were in the following categories - i) paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work), or  ii) self-employment (whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work). For more detailed information, please refer to the Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment
  and labour underutilization, adopted by the Nineteenth International Conference of Labour Statisticians (October 2013) - http://ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-byinternational-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--
