  There is no established convention for the designation of "developed" and "developing" countries or areas in the United Nations system. The aggregation across all institutions is currently done according to the “historical” classification of “Developed regions” and “Developing regions”
  as of December 2021 in the United Nations M49 statistical standard. The removal of this classification from the M49 standard at the end of 2021 makes it more urgent to reach agreement on how to define these terms for the purposes of SDG monitoring. The designations "developed" and
  developing" are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process.
