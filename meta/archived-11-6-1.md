indicator_available: Proportion of Local Authority collected waste in England, by waste management type
national_indicator_description: >-
  The reported data source measures the proportion of waste managed using each management type. This is disaggregated by English Region and Local Authority. This source has been identifed as an appropriate proxy for this indicator in collaboration with the topic expert.

  Disposal Method' refers to the waste management type.
  
  Landfill estimates include recycling, composting or reuse rejects. 
  
  'Incineration with EfW' - EfW is energy from waste. Also included are amounts rejected for recycling, composting or reuse where incineration with EfW is
  reported as the final destination of these rejects. 
  
  Recycled-composted' includes household and non-household sources sent for recycling or for centralised composting; home composting estimates are not included in this total.  It also includes small amounts of materials sent for
  reuse.  Material which was collected for recycling but actually rejected at collection, by the MRF or at the gate of a recycling reprocessor is excluded. The percentage of waste recycled shown above relate to all Local Authority collected waste and so are different to local authority
  “household” recycling rates or the slightly narrower “waste from household” definitions.  The [Annual Results tables](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results) provide further statistics and detail on these.
  
  'Other' includes
  waste treated or disposed through other unspecified treatment processes as well as process and moisture loss.
computation_calculations: >-
  Proportions were counted as the amount of waste from the selected waste disposal method in each local authority or region divided by the total amount of waste collected in that local authority or region. The percentage was then calculated by multiplying proportion by 100.

data_non_statistical: false
data_footnote: >-
  1. 'Other' includes waste treated-disposed through other unspecified treatment processes as well as process and moisture loss. Process and moisture loss may lead to negative values being reported. 2.  Data reported relates only to Local Authority (LA) collected and managed waste, this
  means the majority of commercial waste is not included in this data.

  <p> Tables are based on quarterly data entered by LAs onto WasteDataFlow.  This data is published annually on a financial year basis( April to March). WasteDataFlow is a web-based system for quarterly reporting on Local Authority collected waste data by local authorities to central
  government. </p>  Recycling rates are different to those reported for indicator 12.5.1 because these data relate to all local authority waste for treatment, from both household and that not from households. Local Authority Collected Waste is mostly household waste but includes some
  business waste –similar in nature and composition to household waste where collected by the local authority. Other non household waste such as that from from municipal parks etc and some non-municipal fractions such as construction and demolition waste may also be collected.  This data
  does not include all waste included in the UN metadata - for example, waste from agricultural and industrial premises, schools and hospitals, and construction sites. Sewage sludge, and faecal sludge are also not included in these data. The methodology document for the data source can be
  found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results">here.</a> Tables are based on quarterly data entered by local authorities onto WasteDataFlow. WasteDataFlow is a web-based system for the reporting of collection and
  disposal of waste by Local Authority’s to central government. See the WasteDataFlow website home page <a href="https://www.wastedataflow.org/home.aspx">here.</a> This data is published annually on a financial year basis. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG
  Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

These data partially fulfill the requirements of this indicator as the best available data with a detailed breakdown at an individual local authority level and include data for both urban and rural areas. The data reported here focus on the way waste collected by local authorities in England is managed (e.g landfill vs recycling). However, they do not capture the total waste in each local authority area as most commercial waste is not managed by local government. This information is not currently available at an individual local authority area level. We are exploring possible options to achieve this.
