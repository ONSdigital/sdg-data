**Non-statistical indicator**  On the 25 July 1997, the UK ratified the [agreements](https://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/status2018.pdf) from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. On the same day, it ratified the agreement on the implementation of Part XI of the Convention (the implementation agreement).

In 1998, The Council for the European Union [committed](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31998D0392&from=EN) European Union member states to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI. The UK has transferred certain matters governed by the convention to the EU e.g. conservation and management of sea fishing resources. Further legislation and conventions that the UK government have signed up to have come into force and some of these examples are  - 

[Industrial Emissions Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2010/75/oj),

[Directive on Ship- Source Pollution](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1574248687164&uri=CELEX:32005L0035)

The UK is also a member of [OSPAR](https://www.ospar.org/about), a mechanism by which 15 Governments and the EU cooperate to protect the marine environment in the North East Atlantic.
