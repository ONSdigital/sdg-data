  <a href="https://cites.org/eng">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)</a> - An international agreement between governments, which aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their
  survival. CITES accords varying degrees of protection to <a href="https://cites.org/eng/disc/species.php">over 40,000 species</a> of animals and plants, whether they are traded as live specimens, fur coats or dried herbs.
available_disaggregations: Endangered species type
computation_calculations: Figures provided in Border Force transparency data are given on a quarterly basis. The four quarters of each year have been summed to provide an annual figure of number of seizures, as quarterly seizure data is particularly volatile.
reporting_status: complete
data_non_statistical: false
data_footnote: >-
  <p>Data for 2019 does not include any seizures made at Gatwick airport during Q4, due to a change in reporting systems.</p><p>2020 figures were impacted by the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic (see 'Other Information' below).</p><p>Where figures have been surpressed in the source data, they have
  been removed. This means that in cases where all four quarters were surpressed, there is no data point available for that year.</p>

  <p>The total number of seizures may not equate to the sum of the CITES seizures. CITES record the number of individual specimens seized, whereas <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/border-force-transparency-data-q1-2023">Border Force transparency data</a> presented here
  reports the number of seizures not specimens. Moreover, this number may differ due to single and multiple seizures recorded by the Border Force data. Specifically, a multiple seizure is where two or more category types (e.g., caviar and timber) are seized on a particular occasion. Each
  of these seizures are reported against the relevant categories, but are only counted once in the total number of seizures.</p><p>The data displayed on this page does not include specimens seized by the police inland which have passed through the UK border undetected. In addition, data
  for 2019 does not include any seizures made at Gatwick airport during Quarter 4, due to a change in reporting systems.</p><p>Seizure numbers in 2020 were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, as there were extremely large reductions in both number of passengers and amount of cargo. In
  addition, enforcement work was disrupted by a stay-at-home order between March and August 2020, and changes to work practices on return.</p><p>For further information on which species are protected by CITES please see <a href="http://checklist.cites.org/#/en">Checklist of CITES
  species</a>, and for further information on trade in CITES species see the <a href="https://trade.cites.org/en/cites_trade/">CITES Trade Database</a>.</p><p>Volume of seizures by type are also available from the source data 
  (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/border-force-transparency-data-q1-2023">Border Force transparency data</a>).</p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global 
  indicator specification. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
