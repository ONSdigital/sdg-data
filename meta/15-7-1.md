  CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) is an international agreement between governments. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. CITES accords varying
  degrees of protection to more than 35,000 species of animals and plants, whether they are traded as live specimens, fur coats or dried herbs.

source_other_info_1:   Please note that the total number of seizures may not equate to the sum of the CITES seizures, this is due to the possibility of multiple seizures. A multiple seizure is where two or more category types (e.g. caviar and timber) are seized on a particular occasion. The occasion is counted
  once in the total number of seizures, but a seizure is counted against each category.
