  <p> 1) All total expenditure figures in this indicator are presented as financial year data and 2019/20, for example, refers to the period April 2019 to March 2020. </p><p> 2) Given the large number of UK public sector organisations funding activities related to biodiversity and the
  complexities involved in both defining and identifying relevant expenditure, the figures presented in this indicator are likely to be an underestimation of total biodiversity spend by the UK public sector. </p><p> 3) Data for natural heritage is based on public sector spending on UK
  biodiversity,it only includes spending provided solely for the protection and promotion of biodiversity and generally excludes operational costs. it includes spending by central government and not that by local authorities. </p>
