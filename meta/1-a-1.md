  <p>Official Development Assistance (ODA) is provided according to the standardised definitions and methodologies of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC). ODA is defined as resource flows to developing countries and
  multilateral organisations, which are provided by official agencies (e.g. the UK Government) or their executive agencies, where each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective and is concessional in
  character. More information on DAC and ODA can be found on the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">OECD website</a>. </p> <p>Poverty reduction ODA flows include
  basic social services and development food aid. These can be identified from the total ODA flows by  Creditor Reporting System purpose codes (Sector Purpose Code/CRS codes) as follows </p> <p>-Basic Education (CRS codes 112xx) </p><p>-Basic Health (CRS codes (122xx) </p><p>-Water Supply
  and Sanitation (CRS codes 140xx) </p><p>-Multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050) </p>-Development Food Aid (CRS code 52010)
computation_calculations: The UK is a donor country, so the indicator represents the sum of bilateral ODA grants that focus on poverty
  reduction (based on the specified CRS codes) as a proportion of the UK’s gross national income (GNI). Calculation is performed as (ODA/GNI) * 100

  The gross national income (GNI) used for the proportion calculations is the same GNI number (based on current methodology in given year) as the GNI used for the ODA to GNI ratio calculations for UK SDG indicators 17.2.1 and 17.3.1. The Office for National Statistics publishes GNI values,
  but for consistency purposes the values used for these calculations were obtained from the OECD repository (Source 2). The OECD sources GNI from the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been
  identified in collaboration with topic experts.
