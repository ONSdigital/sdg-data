national_indicator_description: >-
  For the global part of this indicator we provide the net amount for official development assistance (ODA) provided by the UK towards promoting the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies. For the national part of this indicator we provide
  the total turnover of businesses generated from environmentally sound techologies.

  <p>The indicator is composed of two levels. Level 1 - funding flowing to developing countries for environmentally sound technologies. This is represented by the series "Official Development Assistance (ODA) for environmentally sound technologies".  Level 2 - national data on investment
  in environmentally sound technologies, represented by the series "National investment in environmentally sound technologies (turnover)". Level 2 data is currently a proxy indicator.</p>
  
  <p>Environmentally Sound Technologies (ESTs) are technologies that have the potential for
  significantly improved environmental performance relative to other technologies. ESTs are not just individual technologies. They can also be defined as total systems that include know-how, procedures, goods and services, and equipment, as well as organizational and managerial procedures
  for promoting environmental sustainability. This means that any attempt to provide an assessment of investment into ESTs on either a global or national level must incorporate ways to track funding flows into both hard and soft technologies.</p>
  
  <p>Official Development Assistance
  (ODA) - resource flows to developing countries and multilateral organisations provided by official agencies (e.g. the UK Government) or their executive agencies. Each transaction is administered for the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries and is concessional in character. More information on ODA can be found on the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">OECD website</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Turnover - turnover of a
  business is the value of the goods or services sold during a particular time period. We are currently using turnover generated from EST, as an approximation of national investment in EST. Note that turnover and investment are different concepts, as turnover relates more to the profit
  after an investment. These data are obtained from the Low Carbon and Renewable Energy Economy (LCREE) survey, which is an annual survey in the UK, sampling around 24,000 businesses. For more information refer to the <a
  href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/methodologies/lowcarbonandrenewableenergyeconomylcreesurveyqmi">Quality and Methodology Information</a> document for the LCREE.</p>
available_disaggregations: The national data series provide disaggregation of total turnover for each UK nation. The original source provides further disaggregations based on sector and industry, number of  businesses, employment and other economic variables.
computation_calculations: >-
  <p><b>Funding flowing to developing countries for environmentally sound technologies:</b> using the UN metadata guidance on computation methods, these data have been constructed based on UK ODA sums (net amount) that relate to ESTs. The data source (see Source 1 tab) provides a breakdown
  of all ODA commitments. The information on project title and the corresponding long description for each entry were checked for key words and phrases relating to ESTs. The key words were chosen based on categories of EST outlined in the Global UN metadata for this indicator, as well as
  logical derivatives of these. The net ODA for entries that have matches for these key words in either the project or long description fields were summed for each reporting year.</p> <p>The key words and phrases used are - low carbon, low-carbon, clean technology, environmental
  technology, green technology, cleantech, renewable energy, wastewater management, wastewater treatment, energy storage, energy distribution, water remediation, bioenergy, solar, climate friendly, geothermal, climate smart, sustainable energy, air pollution, carbon footprint, global
  emissions, clean energy, offshore wind, wind energy, wave energy, hydropower, sustainable sanitation, nuclear power, biofuel, atmospheric pollution, biogas, bio-energy, photovoltaic, carbon reduction, energy efficient, biomass energy, nanogrid, nano-grid.</p> <p><b>National data on
  investment in environmentally sound technologies:</b> we are currently using turnover generated from EST, as an approximation of investment in EST. The annual turnover is readily available from the LCREE survey (Source 2).</p>

  Latest ODA flows data are obtained from table “Data underlying the SID publication”, using columns "ProjectTitle" and "LongDescription" to filter and then sum the net values (see calculations information in National metadata tab). Previous data (2009 to 2016) are available from [SID for

other_info: This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
