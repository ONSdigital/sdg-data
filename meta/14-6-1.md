**Non-statistical indicator**               

In 2018, the UK was assessed to be in Band 5 - Very high implementation of applicable instruments to combat IUU fishing. This score was calculated based on an assessment of the degree of adherence with, and implementation of, the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement and the 2009 FAO agreement on Port State measures. The calculation of this score also considered the development and implementation of the national action plan to combat IUU fishing, and the implementation of Flag State Responsibilities.

This assessment is based on the [UK’s response](https://www.seafish.org/media/1685298/seafish_version_-_uk_fao_ccrf_aquaculture_questionnaire_2017_-_final.pdf) to questions within the [Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF)](http://www.fao.org/3/a-v9878e.pdf) survey.
