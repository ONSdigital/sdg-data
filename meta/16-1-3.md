  <p>The year format refers to the two years covered by the data, from April of the first year to March of the following year. For example, 2018/19 covers the period of April 2018 to March 2019. <br>Figures on physical violence are based on the population aged 16 and above. Figures on
  sexual violence are based on the population aged 16 to 59. <br>The definition of disability used is consistent with the core definition of disability under the Equality Act 2010. A person is considered to have a disability if they have a long-standing illness, disability or impairment
  which causes difficulty with day-to-day activities.</p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
