  1. Figures are unavailable on estimates based on fewer than 50 respondents. 2. Please note the reliability of these estimated figures varies and any year on year differences seen may not be statistically significant. For further information on the quality of the estimates please refer to
  the source data which provides the unweighted base sizes of the samples. Physical violence - 1. Physical violence includes wounding, assault with minor injury and assault without injury. Sexual violence - 1. The sample size is lower between 2010/11 and 2012/13 due to use of a split-
  sample experiment in these years. Please refer to the publication linked in the sources for further information. 2. New questions were introduced into the survey in 2012/13, and estimates from this year onwards are calculated using these new questions. Estimates for earlier years are
  calculated from the original questions with an adjustment applied to make them comparable to the new questions.
