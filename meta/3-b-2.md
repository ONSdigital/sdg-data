  <p>Official Development Assistance (ODA) - resource flows to developing countries and multilateral organisations provided by official agencies (e.g. the UK Government) or their executive agencies. Each transaction is administered for the promotion of the economic development and welfare
  of developing countries and is concessional in character. More information on ODA can be found on the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">OECD website</a>. ODA
  recipients are broken down in groups according to their Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.<p>Country income classification - the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of countries eligible to receive ODA is based on Gross National Income per capita as published by the <a
  href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD">World Bank</a>. All low and middle income countries are included, with the exception of G8 members, EU members, and countries with a firm date for entry into the EU. The list also includes all Least Developed Countries (LDCs) as
  defined by the <a href = "https://www.un.org/ohrlls/content/least-developed-countries%20">United Nations (UN)</a>.<p>LDCs - Least Developed Countries<p>LMICs - Lower-middle Income Countries<p>UMICs - Upper Middle Income Countries<p>Other LICs - Other Low Income Countries<p>Undefined -
  ODA that cannot be allocated to a single country<p><p> Sector Purpose Codes (CRS codes) - the DAC Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases. In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC
  databases. This indicator is based on ODA flows grouped under CRS code 12182 (medical research) and all codes in the 122 series (basic health). The sector classification codes can be found on the <a href = "http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm">OECD website<a/>.

  The ODA data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International Development (SID) was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes and recipient country income classification. The codes used to measure net ODA to the medical research and basic health sectors were those that
  sit under the specific CRS code 12182 and Broad Sector Code 122 (which corresponds to all CRS codes in the 122 series).
