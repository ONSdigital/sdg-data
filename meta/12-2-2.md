computation_units: Thousand tonnes, Tonnes per capita, Tonnes per GDP (£m)
computation_definitions: Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a standard material flow accounting (MFA) indicator and reports the apparent consumption of materials in a national economy.
computation_calculations: >-
  Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) is calculated as direct imports (IM) of material plus domestic extraction (DE) of materials minus direct exports (EX) of materials measured in metric tonnes. DMC per capita is calculated as DMC/UK population estimates(\*1000). DMC per GDP is calculated
  as DMC/GDP(\*1000).
reporting_status: complete
data_non_statistical: false
data_footnote: >-
  1. 'Other' and 'waste for final treatment and disposal' imports and exports have been allocated to categories within Domestic Material Consumption using a Eurostat method. 2. Total material input and consumption for 2016 onwards may be slight underestimates due to small missing data
  sources on extraction for some minor materials. 3. Total figures are based on raw data and therefore may not sum due to rounding.
