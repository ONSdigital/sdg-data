  Development Assistance Committee (DAC) - A unique international forum of many of the largest funders of aid, including 30 DAC Members. The World Bank, IMF and UNDP participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA) - The DAC defines <a href=
  'http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm'>ODA </a>as “those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local
  governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated
  at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). <a href= http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf'>Other official flows (OOF)</a> (para 24) (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the
  conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional. Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes
  aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid -  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral
  Organisations.  Purpose Codes - The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector
  classification codes used can be found on the <a href= 'http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm'>OECD website.</a>

  The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes, bilateral and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of aid codes. The codes used to measure net ODA to the agriculture
  sector sit under DAC 5 Code 311 with the addition of CRS code 43040 (Rural Development) as defined by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Metadata for Indicator 2.a.2.

  Figures may not sum to totals due to roundings.  In the CRS (Creditor Reporting System), data on the sector of destination are recorded using 5-digit purpose codes.  The first three digits of the code refer to the corresponding DAC5 sector or category.  Each CRS code belongs to one and
  only one DAC5 category.  Generally, the last two digits of the CRS purpose code are sequential and not hierarchical i.e., each CRS code stands for itself and can be selected individually or grouped to create sub-sectors. The Governance and civil society, general sector is an exception
  where purpose codes are hierarchically structured.   It is not possible to track directly the destination or purpose of UK funding to the general core budgets of the multilateral organisations. However a good indication of where UK funding goes is provided by OECD DAC data where the
  multilaterals report aid spend by country and sector. Therefore the multilateral data are estimates which have been calculated on the basis of the UK's share of the multilaterals' reported aid spending to the OECD.  The OECD data cover most of the main multilaterals the UK funds.  About
  15% of the UK's core multilateral funding is not covered by the OECD data, and this unreported spending is allocated to the developing countries unspecified category.   More details on the estimates' quality are found in the Imputed multilateral share quality report (Statistics on
  International Development 2016). Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
