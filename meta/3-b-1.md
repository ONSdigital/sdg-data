  In September 2014 the routine HPV programme was changed from a three to two-dose schedule.  The recommendation was to offer the first (priming) HPV vaccine dose in Year 8 (aged 12 to 13 years) and the second dose in Year 9 (aged 13 to 14 years), previous all three doses had been offered
  in year 8.  However, in some areas the second dose was scheduled within the same school year, from six months after the first dose. Consequently, for the first year of the two-dose programme (2014/15) national-level data are only available for the priming dose, and are therefore not
  included in the chart above. National coverage for the completed course of HPV vaccination for the first cohort offered the two-dose schedule was published in 2015/16.  Please see the source data for full defintions and notes. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN
  SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
