national_geographical_coverage: England and Wales
computation_units: Rate per 100,000 population
computation_definitions: Age-standardised mortality rates per 100,000 population are standardised to the 2013 European Standard Population. Age-standardised rates are used to allow comparison between populations which may contain different proportions of people of different ages.
computation_calculations: Number of deaths attributed to unintentional poisoning in a year, divided by the population, and multiplied by 100,000.
reporting_status: complete
data_non_statistical: false
data_footnote: >-
  Rates calculated when there were fewer than 3 death registrations in a cell have been surpressed. Rates that are based on between 3 and 19 deaths are potentially unreliable, as the measure may be affected by the small number of events. These can be seen in the original source data.
