  8.4 Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10‑Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production, with developed
  countries taking the lead
indicator: 8.4.1
indicator_name: 8.4.1 Material footprint, material footprint per capita, and material footprint per GDP
national_indicator_description: The UK’s material footprint, or raw material consumption, captures the amount of domestic and foreign extraction of materials needed to produce the products used by households, governments and charities in the UK.
un_designated_tier: Tier II
un_custodian_agency: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
goal_meta_link: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-08-04-01.pdf 
goal_meta_link_text: United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)
national_geographical_coverage: United Kingdom
computation_units: Million metric tonnes, Tonnes per capita, Tonnes per GDP (£m)
computation_definitions: Material Footprint (MF) is the attribution of global material extraction to domestic final demand of a country. The total material footprint is the sum of the material footprint for biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metal ores.
computation_calculations: >-
  Materical Footprint estimates provided are based on a <a href= "https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1798247/6874172/Handbook-country-RME-tool/">Eurostat method</a> and calculated as raw material equivalent of imports (RMEIM) plus domestic extraction (DE) minus raw material
  equivalents of exports (RMEEX). Material footprint per capita is calculated as raw material consumption (material footprint)/UK population(\*1000000). Material footprint per GDP is calculated as raw material consumption (material footprint)/GDP(\*1000000).

  The level of material footprint for the Eurostat approach is shown excluding imports and exports of precious metals. Precious metals (particularly gold) have a high RME factor, so can have distinctive impact on the results. This is particularly true for the UK, who are responsible for
  more than three quarters of the EU’s imports of gold. While the impact is minimal at the total level, it is more evident when looking at the material footprint of metal ores.

  The choice of method used to calculate material footprint has an impact on the final estimates. In 2017, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) consulted extensively with the University of Leeds about developing further environmentally relevant metrics for
  material use and resource efficiency, particularly in carbon terms. As a result, the University of Leeds have developed a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) approach, using a specifically derived UK MRIO database to underpin calculations. These estimates and further information on the
  Eurostat and University of Leeds approach are published in the <a href= "https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/methodologies/measuringmaterialfootprintintheuk2008to2016">Measuring material footprint</a> report. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This
  indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
