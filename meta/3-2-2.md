indicator_available: Number of neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births
national_indicator_description: >-
  These data show the number of neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births. This differs from the UN metadata which ask for the probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that
  period, expressed per 1000 live births.

national_geographical_coverage: United Kingdom
computation_units: Rate per 1,000 live births
computation_definitions: <p>Neonatal death - the death of a child when the age of the child is under 28 days.</p><p> Region - region of usual residence, not region of occurrence.</p><p>Country - Country of occurrence.</p><p>Age - age of the mother.
available_disaggregations: <p>Figures for the UK are only available for  the headline data and for sex.</p><p>Region is only available when 'England' is selected in the Country dropdown menu.</p><p>For all other disaggregations please select 'England and Wales' in the Country dropdown menu first.</p><p>Cross-disaggregations are available for country by sex. <p>Local Authority (and for Wales, Health Board) level data are available in Table 3 of the source data <a href = "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/childmortalitystatisticschildhoodinfantandperinatalchildhoodinfantandperinatalmortalityinenglandandwales"> - Child mortality (death cohort) tables in England and Wales</a>. We have not presented these figures here due to the level of uncertainty in many of the figures. Data on further characteristics are also available from the source, and we are working to include some of these in future updates.
computation_calculations: Where rates were not provided in the source data, the following calculation was carried out -  (Number of neonatal deaths / number of live births) * 1000 
reporting_status: complete
data_non_statistical: false
data_footnote: Rates based on fewer than 3 deaths are not shown. Due to the small number of events, the reliability of rates which are based on between 3 and 19 deaths may be affected. Please check the source data to identify these points.
