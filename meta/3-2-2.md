target: 3.2 By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births
indicator: 3.2.2
indicator_name: 3.2.2 Neonatal mortality rate
national_indicator_available: Number of neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births
national_indicator_description: >-
  Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of life)
  may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life.

computation_definitions: >-
  Neonatal death is the death of a child of when the age of the child is under 28 days.  Socio-economic status is defined as the social status of a person based on their occupation, income and education.   Type of registration refers to the address status of the parents, and shows whether
  they are living together or separately.
computation_calculations: Where rates were not provided in the source data, the following calculation was carried out -  (Number of neonatal deaths / number of live births) * 1000 
reporting_status: complete
data_non_statistical: false
data_footnote: Due to the small number of stillbirths in socio-economic category 8, the totals for categories 7 and 8 have been combined to protect confidentiality. Due to the small number of events, the reliability of rates which are based on between 3 and 19 deaths may be affected.

  The headline figures for this indicator cover the United Kingdom however the disaggregation for this indicator do not cover England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland they only cover England and Wales jointly. The exception to this is when regions of England and the regions of Wales
  are specified. Although the headline figures go back to 2000 for neonatal, early neonatal, post neonatal, and infant other disaggregation for the indicator only go as far back as 2008.   The disaggregation of socio-economic status is only shown by type of marital status and type of
  registration. The classification used for socio-economic status is the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
