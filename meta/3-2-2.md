  Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of life)

  Neonatal death is the death of a child of when the age of the child is under 28 days.  Socio-economic status is defined as the social status of a person based on their occupation, income and education.   Type of registration refers to the address status of the parents, and shows whether
  they are living together or separately.
computation_calculations: Where rates were not provided in the source data, the following calculation was carried out -  (Number of neonatal deaths / number of live births) * 1000 
reporting_status: complete
data_non_statistical: false
data_footnote: Due to the small number of stillbirths in socio-economic category 8, the totals for categories 7 and 8 have been combined to protect confidentiality. Due to the small number of events, the reliability of rates which are based on between 3 and 19 deaths may be affected.
