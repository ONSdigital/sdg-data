  Percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors, nurses or midwives) is the percentage of childbirths attended by professional health personnel. According to the revised definition these are competent maternal and newborn health (MNH) professionals educated,
  trained and regulated to national and international standards. They are competent to - (i) provide and promote evidence-based, human-rights based, quality, socio-culturally sensitive and dignified care to women and newborns; (ii) facilitate physiological processes during labour and
  delivery to ensure a clean and positive childbirth experience; and (iii) identify and manage or refer women and/or newborns with complications.Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training course, are not included.
  
  A maternity is a pregnancy resulting in the
  birth of one or more children, including stillbirths. 
  
  A stillbirth is a baby born after 24 or more weeks completed gestation and which did not, at any time, breathe or show signs of life.

  This indicator is a proxy indicator. We are reporting data on births occuring within medical facilities and have not included home births. Home births will on many occasions have a skilled health professional present. There will be some home births which occur without a midwife but an
  ambulance is sent, arriving just before or soon after the birth.  We have included data from NHS medical facilities - (generally) hospitals, maternity units and maternity wings and non-NHS medical facilities including - private maternity units, military hospitals, private hospitals and
  communal establishments.  This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
