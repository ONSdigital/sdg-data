  Percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors, nurses or midwives) is the percentage of childbirths attended by professional health personnel. According to the revised definition these are competent maternal and newborn health (MNH) professionals educated,
  trained and regulated to national and international standards. They are competent to - (i) provide and promote evidence-based, human-rights based, quality, socio-culturally sensitive and dignified care to women and newborns; (ii) facilitate physiological processes during labour and
  delivery to ensure a clean and positive childbirth experience; and (iii) identify and manage or refer women and/or newborns with complications.Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training course, are not included.
  
  A maternity is a pregnancy resulting in the
  birth of one or more children, including stillbirths. 
  
  A stillbirth is a baby born after 24 or more weeks completed gestation and which did not, at any time, breathe or show signs of life.
