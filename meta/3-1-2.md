computation_definitions: >-
  Percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel (generally doctors, nurses or midwives) is the percentage of deliveries attended by health personnel trained in providing lifesaving obstetric care, including giving the necessary supervision, care and advice to women during
  pregnancy, labour and the post-partum period, conducting deliveries on their own, and caring for newborns. Traditional birth attendants, even if they receive a short training course, are not included. A maternity is a pregnancy resulting in the birth of one or more children including
  stillbirths. A stillbirth is a baby born after 24 or more weeks completed gestation and which did not, at any time, breathe or show signs of life.
computation_calculations: >-
  The percentage of women giving birth can be calculated by adding the number of maternities in NHS hospitals to the number of maternities in non-NHS hospitals. The number of maternities in NHS and non-NHS hospitals divided by the total number of maternities, multiplied by 100.

  Maternities in medical facilities used as a proxy.  NHS medical facilities – generally hospitals, maternity units and maternity wings.  Non-NHS medical facilities – including private maternity units, military hospitals, private hospitals and communal establishments. This indicator is
  being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

Home births will on many occasions have a skilled health professional present (a midwife) as some women choose to have a home birth so a midwife attends. There will be some home births which occur without a midwife but an ambulance is sent and arrives just before or soon after the birth - these are births which happen too quick for the mother to get to hospital.<br><br>Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[3.1.2 Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel (CSV 8.198 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/3-1-2.csv)
