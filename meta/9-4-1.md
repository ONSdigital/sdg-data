national_indicator_description: >-
  Carbon dioxide emissions intensity is calculated by dividing the level of carbon dioxide emissions by gross value added (GVA) in constant prices. This is the difference between output and intermediate consumption for any given industry/sector. This means the difference between the value
  of goods and services produced (output) and the cost of raw materials and other inputs which are used up in production (intermediate consumption). Data are in constant prices with 2016 defined as the base year.

  All emissions intensity figures exclude consumer expenditure. "There are a number of changes to the intensity figures since the previous release. This is due to revisions to the GVA figures used." This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible,
  we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
