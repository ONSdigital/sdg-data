indicator_available: CO2 emissions intensity by industry
  
national_indicator_description: >-
  Carbon dioxide emissions intensity is calculated by dividing the level of carbon dioxide emissions by gross value added (GVA) in constant prices. This is the difference between output and intermediate consumption for any given industry/sector. This means the difference between the value
  of goods and services produced (output) and the cost of raw materials and other inputs which are used up in production (intermediate consumption). Data are in constant prices with 2016 defined as the base year.

computation_units: Thousand Tonnes per Million GBP (£)
computation_definitions: Consumer expenditure refers to the consumption of fuels and other products by individuals in the UK, as opposed to the production of these by industry. ‘Consumer expenditure - travel’ consists almost entirely of road transport emissions. 
available_disaggregations: Industry sector
computation_calculations: No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.

  <p>All emissions intensity figures exclude consumer expenditure.</p><p> There are a number of changes to the intensity figures since the previous release. This is due to revisions to the GVA figures used. More information can be found in the source download.</p><p>In September 2021
  methodological improvements were made to the GDP output approach through deflation. Further information can be found in the <a
  href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/methodologies/doubledeflationmethodsanddeflatorimprovementstouknationalaccountsbluebook2021">Double deflation methods and deflator improvements to UK National Accounts, Blue Book 2021</a>. This indicator is being used
  as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
