  9.4 By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective
  capabilities
indicator: 9.4.1
indicator_name: 9.4.1 CO2 emission per unit of value added
national_indicator_available: CO2 emissions intensity by industry
  
national_indicator_description: >-
  Carbon dioxide intensity is calculated by dividing the level of carbon dioxide emissions by gross value added (GVA) in constant prices. This is the difference between output and intermediate consumption for any given industry/sector. This means the difference between the value of goods
  and services produced (output) and the cost of raw materials and other inputs which are used up in production (intermediate consumption). Data are in constant prices with 2016 defined as the base year.
