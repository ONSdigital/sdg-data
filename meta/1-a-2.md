  This indicator expresses government expenditure on education as a percentage of total government expenditure. Public Sector Expenditure is used instead of Total Managed Expenditure (TMS) as the total of government expenditure. This is because using the total education figure divided TMS
  may underestimate the percentage spent on education spending, as there could be some education spending in the Accounting Adjustments that hasn’t been or can’t be allocated by function.

  From 2011-12 onwards the 'grant-equivalent element of student loans' is no longer part of the Total Expenditure on Services (TES) framework and has therefore been removed from the Education function. Therefore figures are not directly comparable between 2010-11 and 2011-12. A full
  explanation of this decision can be found in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/public-expenditure-statistical-analyses-2016">PESA 2016 Annex E</a>. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic
  experts.
