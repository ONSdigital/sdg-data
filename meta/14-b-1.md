**Non-statistical indicator**               

In 2018, the UK was assessed to be in Band 4 - High implementation of instruments for access to resources and markets for small-scale fisheries.

This assessment is based on the [UK’s response](https://www.seafish.org/media/1685298/seafish_version_-_uk_fao_ccrf_aquaculture_questionnaire_2017_-_final.pdf) to questions within the [Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF)](http://www.fao.org/3/a-v9878e.pdf) survey.

This score is based on an assessment of the “existence of laws, regulations, policies, plans or strategies that target or address small scale fisheries (SSF); initiatives to implement the SSF guidelines; mechanisms through which small scale fishers and fish workers can contribute to decision making processes”.
