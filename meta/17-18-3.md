**Non-statistical indicator** 
<p>The UK has a national statistical strategy which renews every 5 yeas and is set by the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA). The current strategy is called <a href="https://uksa.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/statistics-for-the-public-good/">Statistics for the Public Good</a> and it sets the aims, priorities, mission and values for the period 2020-2025.</p>

<p>The UKSA Business Plan outlines how this strategy supports professional oversight of the UK system of official statistics and exclusive responsibility for the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This statistical strategy is government funded and under implementation.</p>
