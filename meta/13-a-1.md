  <p>Adaptation - Adaptation is about adjustment to climate and its effects. The specific definition that applies to the data presented is - An activity that 'intends to reduce the vulnerability of human or natural systems to the current and expected impacts of climate change, including
  climate variability, by maintaining or increasing resilience, through increased ability to adapt to, or absorb, climate change stresses, shocks and variability and/or by helping reduce exposure to them.' (OECD DAC Rio Markers for Climate - Handbook).<p>Mitigation - Mitigation is about
  reducing the causes of climate change, by reducing the sources or enhancing the sinks of greenhouse gases. The specific definition that applies to the data presented is - An activity that 'contributes to the objective of stabilisation of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the
  atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system by promoting efforts to reduce or limit GHG emissions or to enhance GHG sequestration.' (OECD DAC Rio Markers for Climate - Handbook).<p>Cross-cutting - Cross-cutting across mitigation
  and adaptation.<p>Other - This category was used up to 2016 to account for spend in cross-cutting programmes that could not be broken down into mitigation and adaptation elements. Since 2016 more spend has been able to be reported as either mitigation and adaptation, with any spend not
  able to be broken reported as cross-cutting.</p><p>UNFCCC - <a href="https://unfccc.int/about-us/about-the-secretariat">The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>. <p> OECD - <a href="https://www.oecd.org/">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a>.

  <p>The UK has reported annual spend from its Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget that it has assessed as having clear climate change objectives. All reported UK International Climate Finance (ICF) is ODA. The UK does not include attributed shares of its core/general
  contributions to the Multilateral Development Banks as climate finance and these are not included in these figures. The UK has provided the majority of its climate finance via grants.<p>100% of Green Climate Fund contributions are counted as climate specific. The Global Environment
  Facility has a wider remit than climate and this has been accounted for in the amount scored as climate specific. For the purposes of reporting,  these climate specific multilateral contributions are included in cross-cutting but could be split 50% adaptation and 50% mitigation.
  Contributions through other channels are identified as climate specific when they are assessed as having clear climate change objectives.<p>Building on the commitment to £3.87 billion in ICF between 2011/12- 2015/16, the UK committed to further scale up climate finance to at least £5.8
  billion between 2016/17-2020/21. The UK has furthered this commitment by doubling its ICF to £11.6 billion between 2020/21 and 2025/26.<p>The reported finance is the amount recorded as spent for UK Government budgetary purposes (in £m and then converted to $m using <a
  href="https://data.oecd.org/conversion/exchange-rates.htm">OECD exchange rates</a> from 2013, and <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/database/Rates.asp?TD=30&TM=Dec&TY=2011&into=GBP&rateview=D">end of year daily spot rates</a> previously). Therefore, spend that has been
  pledged or committed for future years is not included in the time series above. Spend using promissory notes is included at the deposit stage. These represent a legal promise for the UK to provide the total value of the promissory note to the note’s recipient.<p> Data follows the UN
  specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
