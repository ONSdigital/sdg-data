  Indicator 7.b.1 is in two parts. Part 1 of the indicator ('Investments in energy efficiency as a proportion of GDP...') is currently displaying, and we are in the process of sourcing Part 2 ('...the amount of foreign direct investment in financial transfer for infrastructure and
  technology to sustainable development services'). FDI data disaggregated by ‘sustainability development services’ (or similar) are not currently available, and UN Stat (1) recommend further 'reflections on definition' to inform data acquisition for this indicator.

  This, or part of this, indicator is awaiting the development of internationally established methodology and standards (classified by the UN as tier 3). This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to
  meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
