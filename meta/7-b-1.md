  <p>Solar PV - the direct conversion of solar radiation into electricity by the interaction of light with the electrons in a semiconductor device or cell.</p><p>Bioenergy - renewable energy made from material of recent biological origin derived from plant or animal matter, known as
  biomass. </p><p>Anaerobic Digestion (AD) - a natural process in which microorganisms break down organic matter, in the absence of oxygen, into biogas (a mixture of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane) and digestate (a nitrogen-rich fertiliser). The biogas can be used directly in engines for
  Combined Heat and Power (CHP), burned to produce heat, or can be cleaned and used in the same way as natural gas or as a vehicle fuel.</p>

  <p>Source 1 contains an estimate of non-fossil fuelled capacity used for co-firing of renewables based on the proportion of generation accounted for by the renewable source that is not reported here. This is applicable for Other Bioenergy  and the sub category Biomass and Waste. </p> <p>
  In each year, some sites have not been attributed to a region so that data related to individual companies are not disclosed. Specific information related to this is contained within the tables in the source 1 data link under the Sources tab.</p> <p> Data follows the UN specification for
  this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
