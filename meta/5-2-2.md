  1. Data broken down by 'place of occurrence', 'relationship with perpetrator' and 'frequency of sexual assault' are based on rape or assault by penetration (including attempts) experienced since the age of 16. If the victim had experienced more than one sexual assault, the most recent
  incident was reported for place of occurrence and relationship with perpetrator. These data use the number of women and girls who were victims of sexual assault as the denominator. 2. Data for some ethnic groups are unavailable due to small sample sizes. 3. Relationship with perpetrator
  - Other known includes date, friend, neighbour, an acquaintance (outside work or school/college/university), person in a position of trust or authority (not at work, school or university), colleague/peer from work or school/college/university. Percentages may sum to more than 100, as
  multiple perpetrators could be identified.

  <p>For details of the Crime Survey for England and Wales, see the <a href='https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology'>user guide to crime statistics for England and Wales.</a></p><p>The year format refers to the two years
  covered by the data, from April of the first year to March of the following year. For example, 2018/19 covers the period of April 2018 to March 2019.</p><p>For further information on the quality of the estimates please refer to the source data which provides the unweighted base sizes of
  the samples.</p><p>The sample size is lower between 2010/11 and 2012/13, and between 2017/18 and 2018/19 due to use of a split-sample experiment in these years. The methodological note titled <a
  href='http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160106010543/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/crime-statistics-methodology/methodological-notes/split-sample-for-intimate-personal-violence-2013-14.pdf'>Split sample for intimate personal violence 2013-14</a>
  provides further information.</p><p>The Crime Survey for England and Wales includes a 'Nature of serious sexual assault' module where detailed data on sexual violence is collected every 3 years. This module was last included in the 2016/17 survey. Therefore detailed breakdowns such as
  'place of occurrence' and 'relationship with the perpetrator' are available for 2016/17 only. This module is only asked of respondents who have experienced rape or assault by penetration (including attempts) since the age of 16.</p><p>The definition of disability used is consistent with
  the core definition of disability under the Equality Act 2010. A person is considered to have a disability if they have a long-standing illness, disability or impairment which causes difficulty with day-to-day activities.</p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG
  Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
