One is provided on a full-time equivalency basis by the World Bank and follows the UN specification for this indicator.  This is displayed here as the headline data.  \n\nAnother measure is calculated using the Labour Force Survey by the Office for National Statistics using a headcount of both full-time and part-time workers.  The headcount figures are valuable, despite not following the UN specification, as they allow us to disaggregate by some of the Leave No-one Behind characteristics, for example, migratory and disability status.\n\nYou can switch between the two options below by using Units toggle on the left hand side. Please note, disaggregations are only available when the headcount option is selected."}
