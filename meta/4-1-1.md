  At age 7, schools are categorised into infant schools (those with highest statutory pupil age of 7), primary schools (those with highest statutory pupil age between 8 and 11) and other schools (those with highest statutory pupil age greater than 11). At age 11, schools are categorised
  into primary schools (those with lowest statutory age below 7 and highest statutory age of 11), junior schools (those with lowest statutory age of 7 or above and highest statutory age of 11) and other schools (those with highest statutory age greater than 11 - this category includes
  middle and all-through schools. For age 16, minimum proficiency is defined for the purpose of this indicator as achieving a grade 4 or above.

  1.Figures for Poole local authority are not included, as this merged to become Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole in 2019. 2. Figures for the City of London and the Isles of Scily for attainment at age 7 have been removed due to being suppressed in the source publication, as they were
  based on data from a single school. 3. From 2017, new reformed GCSEs were introduced into performance tables and are graded using a new 9-1 scale. A time series comparison can only be shown at agreed anchor points (9-7/A*-A, 9-4/A*-C, 9-1/A*-G) as comparisons between other grades are not
  possible.

  For ages 7 and 11, figures before 2016 are not comparable to figures from 2016 onwards due to a change in assesments. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator
  specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

Note that while headline data and the breakdown by sex are for all schools, the breakdowns by all other characteristics (such as special educational needs or region) are only for state schools. For age 16 proficiency, 'achieving grade 4 or above' is used as it is the expected standard for students in that age group.
