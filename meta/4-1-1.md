  For ages 7 and 11, figures before 2016 are not comparable to figures from 2016 onwards due to a change in assesments. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator
  specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

Note that while headline data and the breadkdown by sex are for all schools, the breakdowns by all other characteristics (such as special educational needs or region) are only for state schools. For age 16 proficiency, 'achieving grade 4 or above' is used as it is the expected standard for students in that age group.<br><br>Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[4.1.1 Proportion of children and young people - (a) in grades 2/3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex (CSV 57.484 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/4-1-1.csv)
