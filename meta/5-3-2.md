  Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) refers to “all procedures involving partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons" (World Health Organization, Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation - An interagency
  statement, WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIFEM, OHCHR, UNHCR, UNECA, UNESCO, UNDP, UNAIDS, WHO, Geneva, 2008, p.4). The World Health Organisation defines the four types of female genital mutilation as follows -
  
  Type 1 - Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans (the external and visible
  part of the clitoris, which is a sensitive part of the female genitals, with the function of providing sexual pleasure to the woman), and/or the prepuce/clitoral hood (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoral glans).
  
  Type 2 - Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and the
  labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without removal of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva).
  
  Type 3 - (Often referred to as infibulation). Narrowing of the vaginal opening with the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and
  repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora. The covering of the vaginal opening is done with or without removal of the clitoral prepuce/clitoral hood and glans (Type I FGM).
  
  Type 4 - All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example
  pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization.

  The period April to March is used to report annual data for the number of cases of FGM in England.  Please note that individuals refers to all patiens in the reporting period where FGM was identified or a procedure for FGM was undertaken, and that therefore the year in which the case of
  FGM is reported may not be the same as the year in which FGM took place. In order to create percentages, mid-year estimates have been used from the year that covers the majority of the FGM reporting year; i.e. for the FGM reporting year 2014/15, 2014 mid-year estimates of population have
  been used.  This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
