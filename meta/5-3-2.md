  Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) refers to “all procedures involving partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons" (World Health Organization, Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation - An interagency
  statement, WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNIFEM, OHCHR, UNHCR, UNECA, UNESCO, UNDP, UNAIDS, WHO, Geneva, 2008, p.4).

  The period April to March is used to report annual data for the number of new cases of FGM in England.  In order to create a rate per 1,000,000 population, mid-year estimates have been used from the year that covers the majority of the FGM reporting year; i.e. for the FGM reporting year
  2014/15, 2014 mid-year estimates of population have been used.  This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has not been identified in
  collaboration with topic experts.
