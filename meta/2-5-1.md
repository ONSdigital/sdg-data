  2.5 By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and
  fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed

national_indicator_available: Cumulative Enrichment Index of plant genetic resources in the UK
national_indicator_description: >-
  The Enrichment Index is a proxy measure of genetic diversity based upon the assumption that genetic diversity increases (to a greater or lesser extent) with originality of accessions, which is estimated based on - the number of species collected;  the number of accessions collected; the
  number of countries collected from; and the area from which collection took place.

  The conservation of plant and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA) in medium or long term conservation facilities (ex situ in gene banks) represents the most trusted means of conserving genetic resources worldwide. Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities
  can be easily used in breeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm. The measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to which we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use and thus
  protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, i.e. in situ, or on-farm.
  The two components of the indicator, plant and animal GRFA, are separately counted.
  Plant genetic resources - The plant component is calculated as the number of
  accessions of plant genetic resources secured in conservation facilities under medium or long term conditions, where an ‘accession’ is defined as a distinct sample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a gene bank. <a
  href="http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/">Gene bank Standards for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture</a> set the benchmark for current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key
  international policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary standards have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its  <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf">Fourteenth Regular
  Session</a>.
  
  Animal genetic resources - The animal component is calculated as the number of local breeds stored within a gene bank collection with an amount of genetic material stored which is required to reconstitute the breed (based on the Guidelines on Cryoconservation of Animal
  Genetic Resources, FAO, 2012, accessible <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm">here</a>). The guidelines have been endorsed by the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/024/mc192e.pdf">Thirteenth
  Regular Session</a>.
