  <p><b>Sub-indicator a) Official development assistance on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity</b><p>Values given are the sum of all UK ODA in a target year that have a SectorPurposeCode (CRScode) = 41030. This code relates to ODA flows that have
  biodiversity as a principal
  or significant objective.<p> <p><b>Sub-indicator b) Revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments</b><p>No calculations were required as data are available straight from the source</p>
