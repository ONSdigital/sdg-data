  <p><b>Sub-indicator a) Official development assistance on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity</b><p>Official Development Assistance (ODA) - Resource flows to developing countries and multilateral organisations provided by official agencies (e.g. the UK Government) or their
  executive agencies. Each transaction is administered for the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries and is concessional in character. More information on ODA can be found on the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">OECD website</a>. ODA recipients are broken down in groups according to their Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.<p>Country income classification - The Development Assistance Committee
  (DAC) list of countries eligible to receive ODA is based on Gross National Income per capita as published by the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD">World Bank</a>. All low and middle income countries are included, with the exception of G8 members, EU members,
  and countries with a firm date for entry into the EU. The list also includes all Least Developed Countries (LDCs) as defined by the <a href = "https://www.un.org/ohrlls/content/least-developed-countries%20">United Nations (UN)</a>.<p>LDCs - Least Developed Countries<p>LMICs - Lower-
  middle Income Countries<p>UMICs - Upper Middle Income Countries<p>Other LICs - Other Low Income Countries<p>Undefined - ODA that cannot be allocated to a single country<p><b>Sub-indicator b) Revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments</b><p>
  <p>Biodiversity-relevant taxes - Revenue raised from taxes and auctioning of tradable permits directed at biodiversity.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-indicator a) Official development assistance on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity</b><p>Values given are the sum of all UK ODA in a target year that have a SectorPurposeCode (CRScode) = 41030. This code relates to ODA flows that have
  biodiversity as a principal
  objective. The underlying data can be found in the "Data underlying the SID publication" dataset available from the link in the Sources tab (Source 1) <p> <p><b>Sub-indicator b) Revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity-relevant economic instruments</b><p>No calculations
  were required as data are available straight from the OECD database (Source 2). </p>
