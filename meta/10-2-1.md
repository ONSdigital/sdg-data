indicator: 10.2.1
indicator_definition: This indicator is a measure of relative income poverty at the
  national level. It measures how far individuals are from the median standard of
  living, approximating a measure of social exclusion. Persons living in relative
  poverty often experience many other forms of social and economic disadvantage through
  unemployment, poor housing, inadequate health care and barriers in accessing education
  and economic, social, political and cultural activities, which can result from social
  stigmatisation.
