  <p>The definition of Intergated Water Resources Managment (IWRM), is based on an internationally agreed definition, and is universally applicable. IWRM was officially established in 1992 and is defined as “a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land
  and related resources in order to maximise economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems”.

  The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main components:<p> i) Enabling environment - this includes the policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the ‘enabling environment’ for IWRM<p> ii) Institutions - includes the range and roles of political, social, economic and administrative
  institutions that help to support the implementation of IWRM <p>iii) Management Instruments - The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions<p>iv) Financing - Budgeting and financing made available and used
  for water resources development and management from various sources.<p>The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main components (UNEP 2016). Each component is also split into two parts; questions concerning the ‘National level’ and ‘Other levels’
  respectively. ‘Other levels’ includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate. These two parts address the wording of Target 6.5, ‘implement [IWRM] at all levels …’. <p>IWRM is measured from, 0
  (implementation not yet started) to 100 (fully implemented). Likewise, indicator resullts can be categorized in a similar way to the survey questions to further aid interpretation; Degree of implementation = Very low (0-9.9); Low (10-29.9); Medium-low (30-49.9); Medium-high (50-69.9);
  High (70-89.9); and Very high (90-100).  Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
