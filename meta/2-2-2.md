computation_units: Percentage (%)
computation_definitions: >-
  The prevalence of undernourishment is an estimate of the proportion of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and healthy life. It is expressed as a percentage.
available_disaggregations: Sex; Index of Multiple Deprivation; Ethnicity; Rural or Urban classification. The latter is only available for the data which uses the WHO Child Growth Standards from academic year 2013 to 2014.
computation_calculations: >-
  <p>The analysis  for the data using the WHO Child Growth Standards was done by running the NCMP data through a bespoke <a href='https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/software'>R package 'anthro</a>, developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) specifically for supplying
  Sustainable Development Goals related figures. <p/> <p> The prevalence represents percentage from the unweighted sample size. <p> The dataset variables used for the analysis were age in months, height, sex, weight, index of multiple deprivation (originally deciles, and recoded into
  quintiles), ethnic group, and rural/urban indicator (recoded into a binary classification). <p/> <p>No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of BMI classifications data as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator. For insight
  into the details of potential calculations please refer to the original source metadata or source contact.

  For BMI classifications, source data may contain additional disaggregations (e.g., by health board) that are not displayed on this page. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the
  global indicator specification. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

<p>Data for malnutrition by type (wasting and overweight) is available for England only. <p/> <p> Data which uses BMI classifications is available for the 4 countries of the UK. However, as the data is acquired from different data sources for each, it is not possible to provide an overall UK figure.
