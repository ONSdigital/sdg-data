  <p>Hate crime- ‘any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards someone based on a personal characteristic.’ This common definition was agreed in 2007 by the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Prison Service
  (now the National Offender Management Service) and other agencies that make up the criminal justice system. There are five centrally monitored strands of hate crime - race or ethnicity; religion or beliefs; sexual orientation; disability; and transgender identity.</p><p>Disability Status
  - The <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/measuring-disability-for-the-equality-act-2010/">(GSS) harmonised "core" definition</a> identifies a person as disabled if they have a physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12
  months or more. It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The 'long-term health condition'
  category therefore includes both disabled and non-disabled people under this definition. The two sub-categories of non-disabled (GSS harmonised) are 'long-term health conditin - does not limit activities' and 'no long-term health condition'. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the
  respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>

This indicator reports on hate crime based on survey data (crime survey for England and Wales). Hate crime is also recorded by the police in England and Wales by police force area. The survey provides a better reflection of the extent of household and personal crime than police recorded statistics because the survey includes crimes that are not reported to, or recorded by, the police. The survey is also a better indicator of long-term trends because it is unaffected by changes in levels of reporting to the police or police recording practices.
The [Hate crime, England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hate-crime-england-and-wales-2019-to-2020) bulletin publishes hate crime statistics based on both police recorded crime and the crime survey for England and Wales.
