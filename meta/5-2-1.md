  According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993), violence against women is “Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts,
  coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following - Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family […]”. See <a href=
  "http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm">here</a> for full definition. Intimate partner violence includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation or any other formal or informal union.

  1. The sample size is lower between 2010/11 and 2012/13, and 2017/18 due to use of a split-sample experiment in these years. Please refer to the publication linked in the sources for further information. 2. The sum of the overarching domestic abuse categories are not the sum of the sub-
  categories, as some victims may be included in multiple categories as they can experience more than one type of abuse. 3. Data broken down by personal and household characteristics are for non-sexual partner abuse. 4. Data for some ethnic groups are unavailable due to small sample sizes.

  New questions were introduced into the survey from the year ending March 2011 and were further revised in year ending March 2013. Estimates from the year ending March 2013 onwards are calculated using these new questions. Estimates for earlier years are calculated from the original
  questions with an adjustment applied to make them comparable to the new questions. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been
  identified in collaboration with topic experts.
