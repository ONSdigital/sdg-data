  1. Data is not available for the year 2007/08 because comparable questions on any domestic abuse, any partner abuse and any family abuse were not included in that year. 2. The sum of the overarching domestic abuse categories are not the sum of the sub-categories, as some victims may be
  included in multiple categories as they can experience more than one type of abuse. 3. Data for some ethnic groups are unavailable due to small sample sizes.

  refers to the two years covered by the data, from April of the first year to March of the following year. For example, 2018/19 covers the period of April 2018 to March 2019.</p><p>For further information on the quality of the estimates please refer to the source data which provides the
  unweighted base sizes of the samples.</p><p>The sample size is lower between 2010/11 and 2012/13, and between 2017/18 and 2018/19 due to use of a split-sample experiment in these years. The methodological note titled <a
  href='http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160106010543/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/crime-statistics-methodology/methodological-notes/split-sample-for-intimate-personal-violence-2013-14.pdf'>Split sample for intimate personal violence 2013-14</a>
  provides further information.</p><p>New questions were introduced into the survey in 2010/11 and were further revised for the survey year 2012/13. Estimates from 2012/13 onwards are calculated using these new questions. Estimates for earlier years are calculated from the original
  questions with an adjustment applied to make them comparable to the new questions.</p><p>The definition of disability used is consistent with the core definition of disability under the Equality Act 2010. A person is considered to have a disability if they have a long-standing illness,
  disability or impairment which causes difficulty with day-to-day activities.</p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been
  identified in collaboration with topic experts.
