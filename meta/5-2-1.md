  <p>Intimate partner violence includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner. Any partner abuse includes non-physical abuse, threats, force, sexual assault or stalking. The Crime Survey for England and Wales <a href=
  'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales'>User guide</a> provides definitions of various types of domestic abuse. </p><p>Disability Status - The <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-
  store/measuring-disability-for-the-equality-act-2010/">(GSS) harmonised "core"</a> definition identifies a person as disabled if they have a physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more. It must reduce their ability to carry-out
  day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that
  disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>

  1. Data is not available for the year 2007/08 because comparable questions on any domestic abuse, any partner abuse and any family abuse were not included in that year. 2. The sum of the overarching domestic abuse categories are not the sum of the sub-categories, as some victims may be
  included in multiple categories as they can experience more than one type of abuse. 3. Data for some ethnic groups are unavailable due to small sample sizes.

  refers to the two years covered by the data, from April of the first year to March of the following year. For example, 2018/19 covers the period of April 2018 to March 2019.</p><p>For further information on the quality of the estimates please refer to the source data which provides the
  unweighted base sizes of the samples.</p><p>The sample size is lower between 2010/11 and 2012/13, and between 2017/18 and 2018/19 due to use of a split-sample experiment in these years. The methodological note titled <a
  href='http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160106010543/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/crime-statistics-methodology/methodological-notes/split-sample-for-intimate-personal-violence-2013-14.pdf'>Split sample for intimate personal violence 2013-14</a>
  provides further information.</p><p>New questions were introduced into the survey in 2010/11 and were further revised for the survey year 2012/13. Estimates from 2012/13 onwards are calculated using these new questions. Estimates for earlier years are calculated from the original
  questions with an adjustment applied to make them comparable to the new questions.</p><p>The Washington Group on Disability Statistics are often used to provide a cross-nationally comparable population-based measures of disability. Please see the article <a href =
  "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/disability/articles/measuringdisabilitycomparingapproaches/2019-08-06">Measuring disability - comparing approaches</a> for a comparison between the GSS Harmonised measure (used here) and the Washington Group
  measure.</p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
