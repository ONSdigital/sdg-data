  1. From 2012/13 onwards the question of feeling alone after the dark was only asked of a quarter of the sample. Questionnaire changes in 2012/13 may mean that estimates prior to this date are not comparable with subsequent years due to potential order effects. 2. The question of feeling
  safe walking alone after dark was not asked in the 2016/17 questionnaire. 3. Data for some ethnic groups are unavailable due to small sample sizes. 4. Data broken down by income is not available for 2018/19 because this information was not collected in the 18/19 questionnaire.
