  From 2012/13, the question of feeling safe walking alone after dark was only asked of a quarter of the sample. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.
  This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
