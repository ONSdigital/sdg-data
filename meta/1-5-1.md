  Death - The number of people who died during the disaster, or directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event. Missing - The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event. It includes people who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence.
  The data on number of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive. Affected - People who are affected, either directly or indirectly, by a hazardous event. Directly affected - People who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced,
  relocated or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. Indirectly affected - People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy,
  critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and psychological consequences. In this indicator, given the difficulties in assessing the full range of all affected (directly and indirectly), UNISDR proposes the use of an indicator that would estimate
  “directly affected” as a proxy for the number of affected. This indicator, while not perfect, comes from data widely available and could be used consistently across countries and over time to measure the achievement of the Target B of the Sendai Framework. [a] An open-ended
  intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) is developing a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework. These indicators
  will eventually reflect the agreements on the Sendai Framework indicators.

  1. Underlying cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes X30 to X39. 2. Figures are for persons usually resident in England and Wales, based on boundaries as of February 2020. 3. Figures are based on deaths registered,
  rather than deaths occurring between 2001 and 2018.  Figures only include deaths that were registered by 31 Dec 2018.

source_other_info_1:   Please note the data source contains separate death rates per 100,000 population for England and for Wales, and death rates by cause of death and sex which have not been included here. This is because in some instances the number of deaths are very small (less than 10), meaning the rate
  is statistically unreliable. Therefore, death rates are only included here for combined England and Wales by sex, as there have been enough deaths to increase reliability of these figures. The absolute number of deaths has been reported for all other breakdowns.

  For more information, please see [Mortality Statistics Quality and Methodology Information](http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/qmis/mortalitystatisticsinenglandandwalesqmi). This document contains important information on the strengths and
  limitations of the data, the quality of the output including the accuracy of the data, how it compares with related data, uses and users and how the output was created. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or
  develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
