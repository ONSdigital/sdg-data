  Hate crime is defined as ‘any criminal offence which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards someone based on a personal characteristic.’ This common definition was agreed in 2007 by the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Prison
  Service (now the National Offender Management Service) and other agencies that make up the criminal justice system. There are five centrally monitored strands of hate crime - race or ethnicity; religion or beliefs; sexual orientation; disability; and transgender identity.

  1. A reliable estimate for transgender-identity cannot be produced due to small numbers in the survey  and are therefore not reported. 2. For details of the Crime Survey for England and Wales, see the <a href=
  'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology'>user guide</a>  to crime statistics for England and Wales. 3. Ethnic group is based on the 2011 Census definition of ethnic group which now includes Chinese in the Asian/Asian
  British group. For more information see section 7.3 of the <a href= 'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology'>user guide.</a> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we
  will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

This indicator reports on hate crime based on survey data (crime survey for England and Wales). Hate crime is also recorded by the police in England and Wales by police force area. The survey provides a better reflection of the extent of household and personal crime than police recorded statistics because the survey includes crimes that are not reported to, or recorded by, the police. The survey is also a better indicator of long-term trends because it is unaffected by changes in levels of reporting to the police or police recording practices.
The [Hate crime, England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hate-crime-england-and-wales-2017-to-2018) bulletin publishes hate crime statistics based on both police recorded crime and the crime survey for England and Wales. <br><br>Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[16.b.1 Proportion of population reporting having personally felt discriminated against or harassed in the previous 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law (CSV 4.593 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/16-b-1.csv)
