  <p>Food production industries are defined using Standard Industrial Classification 2003 (SIC03) from 2000 to 2008 and Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC07) from 2008 onwards. SIC03 - SIC division 01 and 05 are used. SIC07 - SIC division 01 and 03 are used.</p><p> Low pay is
  defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) as the value that is two-thirds of median hourly earnings and high pay is defined as the value that is 1.5 times median hourly earnings. For example, median hourly earnings for full-time employees in 2017 is
  £14.00, therefore low pay employees are considered to be anyone earning below two-thirds of £14.00, which is £9.33, and high pay full-time employees are those earning anything above 1.5 times £14.00, which is £21.00.</p>
