  Any sexual abuse includes both non-contact sexual abuse and contact sexual abuse. Non-contact sexual abuse is defined as where the respondent indicated that someone made them watch or listen to sexual acts or look at sexual images; made or shared sexual images of them; deliberately
  exposed themselves to them or sent them sexual images or videos of themselves or others. The sub-categories of the “contact sexual abuse” category are rape or assault by penetration, including attempts (this includes penetration with any object) and other contact sexual abuse. This
  includes being touched sexually (for example, groping, touching of breasts or bottom, and kissing) or being forced into touching someone else’s body for sexual purposes.

  The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) included a 'Child abuse during childhood' module for the first time in 2015/16. Detailed data on child abuse is collected every 3 years. While 2015/16 data is available on the [ONS
  website](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/adhocs/008191proportionofadultsaged18to29yearswhoexperiencedabuseasachildbeforetheageof16byoffencetypeyearendingmarch2016csew), the data is not reported here due to changes in the definitions of abuse and the
  introduction of non-contact sexual abuse. Therefore the data is not directly comparable. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
