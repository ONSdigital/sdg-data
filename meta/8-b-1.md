**Non-statistical indicator**

In 2019, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) scored the UK in [band 3](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/) for this indicator. This is the highest score available, and signifies that the UK has operationalised a national strategy for youth employment. This score was based on relevant UK policies that were supplied to the ILO and a biennial questionnaire. Please see the global metadata for more information on how this score was calculated.

We have identified the [Education and Skills Act 2008](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/25/contents) as a relevant policy for this indicator.
