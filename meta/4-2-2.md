  <p> Children who are temporarily absent during census week are still recorded in this dataset. However, for January 2021 the proportion of children temporarily absent is a lot higher due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the national lockdown in the UK. For more information about methodology
  please see <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/education-provision-children-under-5-years-of-age-methodology"> Education provision - children under 5 years of age methodology</a>.</p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG
  Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
