  The percentage of children under 5 in government-funded early years provision is defined as the percentage of children under 5 in funded early education provision, made up of the state-funded schools, private, voluntary and independent sectors. It doesnâ€™t include children whose early
  childcare/education is fully privately funded. For 2 year olds, population has been calculated using data supplied by DWP on the estimated eligible population, whilst for 3 and 4 year olds it has been calculated from the ONS population estimates.
available_disaggregations: Age 2 data is only availble since 2015.
computation_calculations: No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.

  <p> Children who are temporarily absent during census week are still recorded in this dataset. However, for January 2021 the proportion of children temporarily absent is a lot higher due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the national lockdown in the UK. For more information about methodology
  please see <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/education-provision-children-under-5-years-of-age-methodology"> Education provision - children under 5 years of age methodology</a>.</p><p> Geographical numbers are rounded to the nearest ten, and
  suppression (including secondary suppression) has been applied where necessary.</p><p> Population estimates are derived from mid-year estimates and projections produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Those at lower geographic levels, such as local authority, are subject to
  a greater degree of error. In some cases, local authority take-up rates can exceed 100%. Therefore, take-up rates at local authority level should be treated with more caution than national take-up rates.<p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where
  possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
