**Non-statistical indicator<p>Sub-indicator a**</p><p>The <a href="https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/">Aichi Biodiversity Targets 2011-2020</a> are a set of five goals and 20 targets to drive action on biodiversity. These goals aim to (1) address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss, (2) reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use, (3) improve the status of biodiversity, (4) enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity, (5) enhance implementation through participatory planning and knowledge management.</p><p>The United Kingdom (UK) agreed to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2010 and reported progress against these targets. In both the <a href="https://data.jncc.gov.uk/data/527ff89f-5f6b-4e06-bde6-b823e0ddcb9a/UK-CBD-6NR-v2-web.pdf">Sixth National Report to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity</a> (2019) and the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee’s report <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/6498/documents/70656/default/">Biodiversity in the UK bloom or bust</a> (2021), the UK was on track to achieving 5 of the 19 targets and failed to meet the other 14 targets. Specifically, the UK was on track to achieve <a href="https://data.jncc.gov.uk/data/527ff89f-5f6b-4e06-bde6-b823e0ddcb9a/UK-CBD-6NR-v2-web.pdf">Target 2</a> outlined by this indicator. For more details on the targets and whether the UK is achieving these targets see the national metadata below.</p><p>Subsequent to the ending of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2020, the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) have built these targets into delivering the 2020 biodiversity strategy (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69446/pb13583-biodiversity-strategy-2020-111111.pdf">Biodiversity 2020 A strategy for England’s wildlife and ecosystem services</a>).</p><p>The devolved administrations of the UK have established a range of country-based initiatives to support the achievement of Aichi Target 2. In England, the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005759/NPPF_July_2021.pdf">National Planning Policy Framework</a> was amended to strengthen the protection for irreplaceable habitats outlining that planning policies and decisions should contribute to and enhance the natural environment. This protection is being expanded nationally in November 2023 with the introduction of Defra’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-biodiversity-net-gain#:~:text=Biodiversity%20net%20gain%20(%20BNG%20)%20is,Planning%20Act%201990%2C%20unless%20exempt.">Biodiversity Net Gain</a> strategy for developers. In Scotland, a <a href="https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/social-and-economic-benefits-nature/natural-capital/scotlands-natural-capital-asset-index">natural capital asset index</a> has been published annually since 2011, measuring the quality and quantity of habitats according to their potential to deliver ecosystem services now and in the future. Wales has introduced the <a href="https://www.futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/">Well-being of Future Generations Act 2015</a> which brings biodiversity into the central decision-making process for public sector bodies in Wales.</p><p>Beyond 2020, the UK has committed to further protection under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-commits-to-protect-30-of-uk-land-in-boost-for-biodiversity">30 by 30 commitment</a>, which aims to protect 30% of land and seas by 2030 with a view to boosting biodiversity.</p><p></p><p>**Sub-indicator b**</p><p>The UK implements the UN <a href="https://seea.un.org/content/global-assessment-environmental-economic-accounting">System of Environmental Economic Accounting</a> (SEEA) in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts">Environmental Accounts</a> and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/methodologies/naturalcapital">Natural Capital Accounts</a> published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The methodology behind the implementation of SEEA in the UK’s Natural Capital Accounts can be found in the ONS publication <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/methodologies/principlesofuknaturalcapitalaccounting2023">Principles of UK natural capital accounting</a> (2023).</p><p>The Environmental Accounts show how the environment contributes to the economy (for example, through the extraction of raw materials), the impacts that the economy has on the environment (for example, energy consumption and air pollution emissions), and how society responds to environmental issues (for example, through taxation and expenditure on environmental protection).</p><p>UK Natural Capital comprises all the ecosystem services that UK natural assets provide; natural assets include soil, air, water, and all living things. The Natural Capital Accounts include both monetary estimates of ecosystem and other service flows, and habitat accounts. The habitat accounts provide estimates of the extent, condition, and asset values of different ecosystem types.</p>
