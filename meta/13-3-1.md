Education in the UK is devolved, and so there is some variance in the approach to Education for Sustainable Development. We have identified relevant links to official curriculums -

England

[National Curriculum in England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-science-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-science-programmes-of-study) - Climate change is taught as part of the science programmes of study.

Northern Ireland

[Northern Ireland GCSE Geography Syllabus](http://ccea.org.uk/geography/) - Climate change is a compulsory part of the GCSE Geography curriculum in Northern Ireland.

Scotland

[Climate Change and Education in Scotland](https://education.gov.scot/improvement/Documents/ClimateChangeinScottishEducationBriefing140819new.pdf) - In Scotland, climate change is addressed through combining experiences and outcomes across curriculum areas in a variety of contexts as part of the theme of Learning for Sustainability.

Wales

[Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship](https://hwb.gov.wales/storage/eaf467e6-30fe-45c9-93ef-cb30f31f1c90/common-understanding-for-school.pdf) - Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship seeks to give learners, at all stages of education, an understanding of the impact of their choices on other people, the economy and the environment. Learners should be given opportunities to understand key concepts surrounding climate change, such as the greenhouse effect , renewable and non renewable energy resources and the implications of climate change as well as the opportunity to appreciate the impacts of their actions on climate change and make personal decisions and changes to combat global warming.
