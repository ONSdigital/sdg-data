indicator_definition: >-
  The probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before
  reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age specific mortality rates of
  that period, expressed per 1000 live births. The under-five mortality rate as
  defined here is, strictly speaking, not a rate (i.e. the number of deaths
  divided by the number of population at risk during a certain period of time)
  but a probability of death derived from a life table and expressed as a rate
  per 1000 live births.

  By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age,
  with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as
  12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per
  1,000 live births

computation_definitions: >-
  It is the probability (expressed as a rate per 1000 live births) of a child
  born alive in a specified period dying before reaching the age of five, if
  subject to current age-specific mortality rates. It is important to point out
  that the reference period is the five-year period preceding the survey date.
  So, the time point that the rate is referred to is the midpoint of the five
  year interval. A live birth is the complete expulsion or extraction from its
  mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the
  pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence
  of life-such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or
  definite movement of voluntary muscles-whether or not the umbilical cord has
  been cut or the placenta is attached. Each product of such a birth is
  considered a live birth.
computation_calculations: >-
  Like other childhood mortality rates, the data used to compute the U5MR is
  derived from the birth history section of Woman's questionnaire of DHS. It
  uses the direct method and data are collected on birth histories of women of
  childbearing age and produces the probability of dying before age one for
  children born alive, among women of childbearing age, during five year periods
  before the survey. The Direct method requires each child's date of birth,
  survival status, and age of the child on the date of the interview if alive
  and if not alive the age at death of each live births
