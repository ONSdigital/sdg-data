  <p>Earnings -  gross remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees, as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done together with remuneration for time not worked, such as annual vacation, other type of paid leave or holidays. Earnings exclude employers’ contributions in
  respect of their employees paid to social security and pension schemes and also the benefits received by employees under these schemes. Earnings also exclude severance and termination pay. For international comparability purposes, statistics of earnings used relate to employees’ gross
  remuneration, i.e. the total before any deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and other obligations of employees. As stated in the indicator title, data on earnings
  should be presented on the basis of the arithmetic average of the hourly earnings of all employees. </p><p>Disability Status - The <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/measuring-disability-for-the-equality-act-2010/">(GSS) harmonised "core" definition</a> identifies a
  person as disabled if they have a physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more. It must reduce  their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not
  reduce/limit their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that
  appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>

  <p>It is very important to observe that the ASHE and APS earnings are not directly comparable, and that APS data is used to disaggregate by disability only because ASHE cannot be disaggregated by disability. The APS data is based on the working population and covers age ranges 16 to 64.
  The ASHE data are collected in April, while APS data are collected across the whole year.</p><p> The Washington Group on Disability Statistics are often used to provide a cross-nationally comparable population-based measures of disability. Please see the article <a
  href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/disability/articles/measuringdisabilitycomparingapproaches/2019-08-06">Measuring disability - comparing approaches</a> for a comparison between the GSS Harmonised measure (used here) and the Washington Group
  measure.</p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
