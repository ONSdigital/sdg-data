  Earnings refer to the gross remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees, as a rule at regular intervals, for time worked or work done together with remuneration for time not worked, such as annual vacation, other type of paid leave or holidays. Earnings exclude employers’
  contributions in respect of their employees paid to social security and pension schemes and also the benefits received by employees under these schemes. Earnings also exclude severance and termination pay. For international comparability purposes, statistics of earnings used relate to
  employees’ gross remuneration, i.e. the total before any deductions are made by the employer in respect of taxes, contributions of employees to social security and pension schemes, life insurance premiums, union dues and other obligations of employees. As stated in the indicator title,
  data on earnings should be presented on the basis of the arithmetic average of the hourly earnings of all employees.

  It is very important to observe that the ASHE and APS earnings are not directly comparable, and that APS data is used to disaggregate by disability only because ASHE cannot be disaggregated by disability. The APS data is based on the working population and covers age ranges 16 to 64. The
  ASHE data are collected in April, while APS data are collected across the whole year. To define disability in this publication we refer to the Government Statistical Service (GSS) harmonised “core” definition - this identifies “disabled” as a person who has a physical or mental health
  condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more, that reduces their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities.<br />The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) and the
  subsequent Equality Act 2010.<br />The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

Further disaggregation by ethnicity are available from [Ethnicity facts and figures](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/ethnicitypaygapreferencetables). Note that the data on the SDG page uses the mean, while the Ethnicity facts and figures use the median.
