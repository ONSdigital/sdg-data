indicator_available: Change in the extent of open water over time
national_indicator_description: Data are presented for open water (large lakes, rivers, estuaries and artificial waterbodies). Water body type is not yet included as a disaggregation. This forms part of sub-indicator 1 -  spatial extent of water related ecosystems.

  <p>Permanent water - area that is under water throughout the year</p><p>Seasonal water - area that is under water for less than 12 months a year</p><p>Ephemeral water - area that is episodically under water in different years</p><p>HydroBASINS - a series of polygon layers that depict
  watershed boundaries at a global scale. They use the Pfafstetter coding system, which allows for analysis of catchment topology. Catchments  can be broken down  into smaller sub-basins; with each subdivision, the Pfafstetter level increases. Here, a Pfafstetter level of 6 was used,
  giving us data for 38 catchments across the UK.

  Specific data for this indicator have been aggregated to HydroBASINs Pfaffstetter level 6 using official UK boundaries. The data shown for this indicator and the code used to produce them can be found on the ONS <a

  <p>Please see the blog Using satellite imagery to report changes to water bodies for SDG 6.6.1 for more information on this indicator (ADD LINK)</p><p>Data for change in the extent of open water is calculated from Earth Observation data (from the Landsat satellite programme). The
  resolution used does not pick up smaller waterbodies (including small lakes, rivers and streams).</p><p>The data presented here are constrained to official high-water mark boundaries, which helps ensure that coastal water is not included in estimates. </p><p>Persistent cloud cover can
  impact the quality of data collection. Anomolous years (likely due to cloud cover - 1994-1998 and 2004-2009) have therefore been excluded from the data presented here, with the exception of the baseline. The baseline period of 2001-2005 includes the anomolous years 2004 and 2005. To
  mitigate the impact of variable cloud cover, the modal value of each pixel across the baseline years has been used to calculate the average spatial extent in the baseline period. Further details on the source data and mitigating the impacts of these anomalous periods is provided in the
  Quality and Methodology document (ADD LINK).</p><p>HydroBASIN catchments are identified with numbers, however we have added descriptive names to each catchment in the dropdown menu - these are not official names. Work is in progress to provide interactive maps. While these are not yet
  available here, they can be viewed in the blog Using satellite imagery to report changes to water bodies for SDG 6.6.1 (ADD LINK)</p>  Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
