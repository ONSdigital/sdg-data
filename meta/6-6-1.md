csv_size: 602.299 kB
indicator_available: Change in the extent of open water over time
national_indicator_description: Data are presented for open water (large lakes, rivers, estuaries and artificial waterbodies). Water body type is not yet included as a disaggregation. This forms part of sub-indicator 1 -  spatial extent of water related ecosystems.

computation_definitions: >-
  <p>Permanent water - area that is under water throughout the year</p><p>Seasonal water - area that is under water for less than 12 months a year</p><p>Ephemeral water - area that is episodically under water in different years</p><p>HydroBASINS - a series of polygon layers that depict
  watershed boundaries at a global scale. They use the Pfafstetter coding system, which allows for analysis of catchment topology. Catchments  can be broken down  into smaller sub-basins; with each subdivision, the Pfafstetter level increases. Here, a Pfafstetter level of 6 was used,
  giving us data for 38 catchments across the UK.

  <p>Please see the blog <a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/using-satellite-imagery-to-report-changes-to-water-bodies-for-sdg-6-6-1">Using satellite imagery to report changes to water bodies for SDG 6.6.1</a> for more information on this indicator.</p><p>Data for spatial extent
  and change of inland lake and reservoir open waters is derived from Earth Observation data (from the Landsat satellite programme). The resolution used does not pick up smaller waterbodies (including small lakes, rivers and streams). These data can be downloaded from the Global Surface
  Water Explorer (GSWE).</p><p>The data presented here have been constrained to official high-water mark boundaries, which helps ensure that coastal water is not included in estimates. Measures therefore differ slightly to those on the <a href="https://www.sdg661.app/">Freshwater
  Ecosystems Explorer</a>, a GSWE platform for presenting data specificaly for this indicator.</p><p>Persistent cloud cover can impact the quality of data collection. Anomolous years (likely due to cloud cover - 1994-1998 and 2004-2009) have therefore been excluded from the data presented
  here, with the exception of the baseline. The baseline period of 2001-2005 includes the anomolous years 2004 and 2005. To mitigate the impact of variable cloud cover, the modal value of each pixel across the baseline years has been used to calculate the average spatial extent in the
  baseline period. Further details on the source data and mitigating the impacts of these anomalous periods is provided in the <a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/projects/quality-and-methodology-extent-and-change-of-surface-water-statistics">Data Science Campus Quality and
  Methodology document</a>.</p><p>HydroBASIN catchments are identified with numbers, however we have added descriptive names to each catchment in the dropdown menu - these are not official names. Work is in progress to provide interactive maps. While these are not yet available here, they
  can be viewed in the blog<a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/using-satellite-imagery-to-report-changes-to-water-bodies-for-sdg-6-6-1">Using satellite imagery to report changes to water bodies for SDG 6.6.1</a>.</p>  Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This
  indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
