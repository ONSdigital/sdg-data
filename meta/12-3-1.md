  SDG 12.3 aims to reduce food loss and waste.  Current UK data is for food waste. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been
  identified in collaboration with topic experts.
