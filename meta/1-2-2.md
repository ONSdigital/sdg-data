indicator_name: 1.2.2 Proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions
national_indicator_available: Percentage of the population living in households at risk of persistent poverty
national_indicator_description: >-
  The percentage of people who are living in households which are deemed at risk of poverty in the national context. Monitoring national poverty is important for country-specific development agendas. National poverty lines are used to make more accurate estimates of poverty consistent with
  the country’s specific economic and social circumstances, and are not intended for international comparisons of poverty rates.

  Household income - The total disposable income of a household is calculated by adding together the personal income received by all of household members plus income received at household level. Missing income information is imputed.  Disposable household income includes i) All income from
  work (employee wages and self-employment earnings), ii) Private income from investment and property, iii) Transfers between households, iv) All social transfers received in cash including old-age pensions  Note - Some of the income components are mandatory only from 2007 - Imputed rent,
  Interest paid on mortgage, and v) Employer's social insurance contributions. From the 2007 year on, all countries have to supply gross income information. The current definition of total household disposable income used for the calculation of EU-SILC based indicators excludes i) Imputed
  rent - i.e. money that one saves on full (market) rent by living in one's own accommodation or in accommodation rented at a price that is lower than the market rent, and ii) Non monetary income components, in particular value of goods produced for own consumption, social transfers in
  kind and non-cash employee income except company cars. Equivalence scale - To take into account the impact of differences in household size and composition, the total disposable household income is "equivalised". The equivalised income attributed to each member of the household is
  calculated by dividing the total disposable income of the household by the equivalisation factor. Equivalisation factors can be determined in various ways. Eurostat applies an equivalisation factor calculated according to the OECD-modified scale first proposed in 1994 - which gives a
  weight of 1.0 to the first person aged 14 or more, a weight of 0.5 to other persons aged 14 or more and a weight of 0.3 to persons aged 0-13. Household - A 'private household' means "a person living alone or a group of people who live together in the same private dwelling and share
  expenditures, including the joint provision of the essentials of living". EU-SILC implementing regulation number 1983/2003 on updated definitions, defines households in terms of sharing household expenses and (for non-permanent members) in terms of duration of stay and (for temporarily
  absent members) in terms of duration of absence. Definitions sourced from “Income and Living Conditions” Metadata (Eurostat).

  At persistent risk of poverty rate by age and gender (cut-off point - 60% of median equivalised income) This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This
  indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
