target: 3.9 By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination
indicator: 3.9.2
indicator_name: 3.9.2 Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH) services)
national_indicator_available: Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene focusing on inadequate WASH services, expressed per 1,000,000 population.
national_indicator_description: >-
  The indicator expresses the number of deaths from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (with focus on WASH services) which could be prevented by improving those services and practices. It is based on both the WASH service provision in the country, as well as the related health
  outcomes, and therefore provides important information on the actual disease caused by the risks measured in 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.

  Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene focusing on inadequate WASH services, expressed per 1,000,000 population; The included diseases are the WASH attributable fractions of diarrhoea (ICD-10 code A00, A01, A03, A04, A06-A09), intestinal nematode infections (ICD-10
  code B76-B77, B79) and protein-energy malnutrition (ICD-10 code E40-E46).
computation_calculations: Number of deaths from unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe WASH services) in a year, divided by the population, and multiplied by 1,000,000.

comments_limitations: >-
  Data rely on (a) statistics on WASH services (6.1, 6.2 and 6.3), which are well assessed in almost all countries, and (b) data on deaths. Data on deaths are also widely available from countries from death registration data or sample registration systems, which are certainly feasible
  systems. Such data are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in countries. The main limitation is that not all countries do have such registration systems to date, and data need to be completed with other type of information. Data follows the UN specification for
  this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
