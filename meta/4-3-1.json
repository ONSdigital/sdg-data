In some countries, the upper parts of this \u2018ladder\u2019 are organized programmes of joint part-time employment and part-time participation in the regular school and university system. Non-formal education and training is defined as any organized and sustained learning activities that do not correspond exactly to the above definition of formal education. Non-formal education may therefore take place both within and outside educational institutions and cater to people of all ages. Depending on national contexts, it may cover educational programmes to impart adult literacy, life-skills, work-skills, and general culture.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"bar","graph_title":"Percentage of adults who have participated in any learning in the last 12 months","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Education","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for Education","source_periodicity_1":"NA","source_earliest_available_1":2016,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"England","source_url_1":"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-education-survey-2016","source_url_text_1":"Adult Education Survey 2016","source_release_date_1":"22/08/2018","source_next_release_1":"NA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"aliki.pareas@education.gov.uk","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"04-03-01","comments_limitations":"The survey sampled individuals in England aged 19 and over who were not in continuous full-time education or who had returned to full-time education following a break of more than two years.
