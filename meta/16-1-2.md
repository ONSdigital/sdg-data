  Conflict-related mortality figures have been compiled from data held by Defence Statistics. Figures are presented for UK Regular Armed Forces deaths as a result of a hostile action. A definition of hostile action includes deaths categorised as Killed In Action (KIA) or Died Of Wounds.
  KIA is defined as a battle casualty who is killed outright or who dies as a result of wounds or other injuries before reaching a medical treatment facility. DOW is defined as a battle casualty who dies of wounds or other injuries received in action, after having reached a medical
  treatment facility. This only includes those who have died of wounds whilst under the care of Defence Medical Services. UK Regulars are defined as full time Service personnel, including Nursing Services, but excluding FTRS personnel, Gurkhas, Naval activated Reservists, mobilised
  Reservists, Military Provost Guarding Service (MPGS) and Non Regular Permanent Service (NRPS). Unless otherwise stated, includes trained and untrained personnel.

  This indicator only includes deaths as a result of hostile action and does not include indirect deaths. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This
  indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
