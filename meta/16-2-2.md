  <p>Child - For this indicator a child is regarded as someone under the age of 18 years, or thought to be under the age of 18 years, at the time of exploitation. </p><p> Trafficking - According to Article 3, paragraph (a) of the UN Trafficking in Persons Protocol, trafficking in persons
  is defined as “the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of
  payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery
  or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs”. </p><p> NRM - The National Referral Mechanism is a framework for identifying and referring potential victims of modern slavery and ensuring they receive the appropriate support. Please see the <a

  <p> 1. These data refer to age at referral, as opposed to age at exploitation. Therefore, overall totals may differ from previously published data tables on age at exploitation. This aligns with data published by the Home Office. </p><p>  2. The National Referral Mechanism was introduced
  on 1st April 2009 and therefore the year ending December 2009 does not contain a whole years' worth of data. </p><p> 3. Trends in the data may not reflect underlying changes in prevalence and may be related to changes in awareness and identification of potential victims. </p><p> 4. Data in the graph and accompanying table is reported to 3 significant figures, with the true values available via the "Download Source CSV" option below.

  <p>There is no one data source that accurately quantifies the number of child victims in the UK. The National Referral Mechanism (NRM) currently provides the best measure of potential victims, although is known to be an undercount.</p><p> Please see the <a

  This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
