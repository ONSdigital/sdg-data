  This, or part of this, indicator is awaiting the development of internationally established methodology and standards (classified by the UN as tier 3). This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to
  meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

[International Climate Finance (ICF)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-climate-finance) is a UK government commitment to support developing countries to respond to the challenges and opportunities of climate change. UK International Climate Finance plays a crucial role in
addressing this global challenge. Three government Departments (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), Department for International Development (DFID), and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) have responsibility for investing the UK’s £5.8bn of
ICF between 2016 and 2021. The UK has developed a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to capture and track results from ICF programmes. 

The [Prosperity Fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cross-government-prosperity-fund-programme/cross-government-prosperity-fund-
update) is a UK cross government initiative that was announced as part of the [2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-security-strategy-and-strategic-defence-and-security-review-2015). It supports the [United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs)](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) as well as the [2015 UK Aid Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aid-tackling-global-challenges-in-the-national-interest) by promoting growth and prosperity in developing
countries. In 2017/18, Ministers endorsed 26
multi-year programmes totalling £1.2 billion,
operating between 2016 and 2023, across - investment in
infrastructure and human capital; innovation
and technology; increasing trade; financial
and economic reform; and ease of doing
business.
Priority countries and regions
included - Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Nigeria,
South Africa, China, India and Southeast Asia. See the [Prosperity Fund annual report 2017 to
2018](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/756412/Cross_government_Prosperity_Fund_Annual_Report_2018.pdf) for more detail.

The Department of International Development (DFID) have also initiated the Cities and Infrastructure for
Growth (CIG) programme where the UK have committed to provide up to £165 million between 2017 and 2023 to support economic growth and job creation in Burma, Uganda and Zambia. Progress of this programme can be followed on DFID's [Development
Tracker](https://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/projects/GB-1-205222).
