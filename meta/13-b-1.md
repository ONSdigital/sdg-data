  This, or part of this, indicator is awaiting the development of internationally established methodology and standards (classified by the UN as tier 3). This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to
  meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.

**Non-statistical indicator**

This, or part of this, indicator is classified as Tier 3 and therefore no internationally established methodology or standards are available, but methodology or standards are being (or will be) developed or tested. Until methodology or standards have been agreed we are reporting/linking to the most relevant source of information.

[International Climate Finance (ICF)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-climate-finance) is a UK government commitment to support developing countries to respond to the challenges and opportunities of climate change. The UK International Climate Finance plays a crucial role in addressing this global challenge. Three government departments - Department for International Development (DFID), Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) have responsibility for investing the UK’s £5.8bn of ICF between 2016 and 2021. The latest [UK ICF results](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/721993/2018-UK-Climate-Finance-Results.pdf) and [previous ICF results](https://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/gb/eu/mmr/art16_finance/) are both available. The results and finance within these reports cover climate work across the UK development portfolio which includes, but is not limited to, least developed countries and small island developing states. 

There are various international development projects that are led by the Department for International Development (DFID), other government departments and partners. Work that supports a range of least developed countries include - 
* Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) - Programme helping people become more resilient to climate extremes in South, Southeast Asia, in the African Sahel and neighbouring countries. This is through improved integration of disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation methods into development approaches, influencing local, national and international policies and practices.
* Weather and climate Information and SERvices for Africa (WISER) - This programme is on track to deliver transformational change in the quality, accessibility and use of weather and climate information at all levels of decision making for sustainable development in Africa. The Met Office is leading the East African component of this programme, enhancing national and regional weather observing and forecasting capabilities in the region. Pan-African work is led by the UNECA African Climate Policy Centre (ACPC). 

Further information on the above programmes are available on the [Development Tracker](https://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/).

Note - DFID programmes mentioned above are included within the finance and results reports published by UK International Climate Finance (ICF).<br><br>
