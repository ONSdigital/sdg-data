national_indicator_description: Total greenhouse gas emissions that occur within the UK’s borders.

computation_definitions: >-
  <p>Carbon dioxide equivalent units -  In accordance with international reporting and carbon trading protocols, each of these gases are weighted by their global warming potential (GWP), so that total greenhouse gas emissions can be reported on a consistent basis (in carbon dioxide
  equivalent units). The GWP (Global Warming Potential) of a greenhouse gas measures its effectiveness in global warming over 100 years relative to carbon dioxide. The GWPs used are from Working Group 1 of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report - Climate Change 2007.<p>Net CO2 emissions - Total
  carbon dioxide emissions minus carbon dioxide removals.</p>
available_disaggregations: Further breakdowns, including fuel type, source sector, and end-user sector are available in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/final-uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics"> UK greenhouse gas emissions final figures</a> source data.

  Gases are weighted by their global warming potential (GWP), so that total greenhouse gas emissions can be reported on a consistent basis (in carbon dioxide equivalent units). The GWP for each gas is defined as its warming influence relative to that of carbon dioxide. The GWPs used are
  from Working Group 1 of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report - Climate Change 2007.

  <p>Figures shown here do not inclue data for the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories, however, those data are available in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/final-uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics">UK greenhouse gas emissions final
  figures</a><p>These figures do not include estimates of emissions outside the UK associated with UK consumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) publishes estimates of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint">UK’s
  carbon footprint</a> annually. Emissions as measured by the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/bulletins/ukenvironmentalaccounts/previousReleases">UK Environmental Accounts</a>, published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS)  measure GHG emissions on
  what is referred to as a “residents” basis, which means that the figures represent emissions caused by UK residents and industry whether in the UK or abroad, but exclude emissions within the UK that can be attributed to overseas residents and businesses.  The <a
  href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-explanatory-notes"> alternative approaches to reporting UK greenhouse gas emissions report</a> outlines the differences between the three approaches.<p>Uncertainty levels for the UK estimates shown here can be
  found in 4.1 of the source data (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/final-uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics">UK greenhouse gas emissions final figures</a>).</p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in
  collaboration with topic experts.
