  Data presented are those provided by <a href="https://www.birdlife.org/redlist">BirdLife International<a/> and the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">IUCN (2020)<a/> to the UN. The Red List Index is based on global estimates of the extinction risk (IUCN Red List categories) of all
  mammals, birds, amphibians, corals and cycads, derived from local and national data, disaggregated to the national scale and weighted by the proportion of each species's distribution in the country or region (in this case the UK).

  <p>IUCN - International Union for Conservation of Nature <p>IUCN Red List - The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is internationally recognised as the most respected and robust inventory of global species conservation status.  It provides a standard and repeatable method for assessing
  the extinction risk status of thousands of animal, fungus and plant species.

  <p>The Red List Index value ranges from 1 (all species are categorised as ‘Least Concern’) to 0 (all species are categorised as ‘Extinct’), and so indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. A downward trend in the Red List Index over time means that the
  expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected
  rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. An upward Red List Index trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened species
  is on track. A Red List Index value of 1 would indicate that biodiversity loss has been halted.<p>The Red List Index reported here is based on global classifications for each species. In other words this Index does not indicate risk of extinction within the UK, but rather, risk of global
  extinction of species found within the UK.  <p>More detailed information on trends in UK Biodiversity, including information on the National Red List can be found in the <a href="https://nbn.org.uk/stateofnature2019/reports/">State of Nature Report</a>.<p>The Red List Index is based on
  quantitative objective categories and criteria. To avoid spurious results from biased selection of species, the Red List Index is calculated from taxonomic groups for which all species have been assessed and reassessed, and, for taxonomic groups that that do not fulfil this criteria,
  species that are representatively sampled. Changes between categories reflect geniune improvement or deterioration in status, not as a consequence of changes in taxonomy or knowledge. <p>The Red List Index is calculated on an annual basis, however, this does not reflect re-assessment of
  all species, as species are not assessed every year. The full methodology, and information on limitations can be found in the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-05-01.pdf">global metadata</a> and references therin.<p>  Data follows the UN specification for
  this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
