  Gender (GPI), Location (LPI) and Social Economic Status (SES) Parity indices
  for educational indicators
national_geographical_coverage: United Kingdom
computation_units: Parity Index
computation_definitions: >-
  Parity indices require data for the specific groups of interest. They
  represent the ratio of the indicator value for one group to that of the other.
  Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is placed in the numerator. A
  value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.
computation_calculations: >-
  The indicator value of the likely more disadvantaged group is divided by the
  indicator value of the other sub-population of interest.
data_footnote: >-
  Several of the GPI and GPIA values are marked 'UIS Estimation' on the source
  data. Low GPIA values do not represent a property of the GPIA calculation, but
  are due to low values of the male/female rates. UIS will review these cases in
  the future.

**Expert Led**

This, or part of this, indicator is classified as Tier 3 and therefore no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available, but methodology or standards are being (or will be) developed or tested. Until methodology or standards have been agreed we are reporting/linking to the most relevant source of information.

Data follows the UN specification for this indicator and has been indentified in collaboration with topic experts.

The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>.
