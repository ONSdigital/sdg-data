computation_units: Parity Index
computation_definitions: >-
  Parity indices require data for the specific groups of interest. They represent the ratio of the indicator value for one group to that of the other. Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is placed in the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.
computation_calculations: The indicator value of the likely more disadvantaged group is divided by the indicator value of the other sub-population of interest.
reporting_status: complete
data_non_statistical: false
data_footnote: Several of the GPI and GPIA values are marked 'UIS Estimation' on the source data. Low GPIA values do not represent a property of the GPIA calculation, but are due to low values of the male/female rates. UIS will review these cases in the future.
