Please note - The majority of cases of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD's) in the UK are imported cases from outside of the UK, and caution needs to be applied when interpreting the data. There are a number of factors that play a role in influencing infection, and treatment usually occurs in the UK and not the country of origin. More information on neglected tropical diseases in the UK can be seen in the following guidance pages - [Dengue fever](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dengue-fever-guidance-data-and-analysis), [Chikungunya](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/chikungunya), [Rabies](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rabies-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention).<br><br>Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[3.3.5 Number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases (CSV 19.606 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/3-3-5.csv)
