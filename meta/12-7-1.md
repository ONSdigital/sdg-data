**Non-statistical indicator**
This, or part of this, indicator is classified as Tier 3 and therefore no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available, but methodology or standards are being (or will be) developed or tested. Until methodology or standards have been agreed we are reporting/linking to the most relevant source of information.

We have identified the following policies relevant to this indicator - [Sustainable procurement - the Government Buying Standards (GBS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sustainable-procurement-the-government-buying-standards-gbs).<br><br>
