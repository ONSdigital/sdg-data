  The monetary poor are identified as individuals living in a household with an equivalised (using the modified-OECD scale) household disposable income before housing costs of less than 60% of that of the national median figure. Government spending taken into consideration is any spend on
  direct transfers of cash benefits, education services and the National Health Service. The proportions reported relate to the amount of government spending on the monetary poor relative to overall government spending.

  <p> This survey data is known to under-report benefit income. Therefore, the figures may be different to those published elsewhere and are likely to be less than the actual proportion of government spending on the monetary poor. Furthermore, data on incomes at the very top and bottom of
  the distribution are less reliable, therefore, ‘monetary poor’ may sometimes include people who’s incomes are volatile and may not actually be considered to be ‘monetary poor’. </p> <p> Data on education and the NHS are modelled to predict the amount households receive. For certain
  aspects of spending on education and the NHS, the models predict how much spending goes towards specific age groups, different genders and different regions, so the demographic information of the survey respondents is used to allocate government spending across the population. </p> Data
  follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
