The data source for this indicator; the Prindex survey, used a sample size of 1,000 in the United Kingdom. This small sample size limits the reliability of the data and restricts our ability to produce detailed further breakdowns of the data. We are exploring how to further develop our reporting of this indicator with stakeholders from the Department for International Development and the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government.
