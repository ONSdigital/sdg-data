  Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total value of goods produced and services provided in a country during one year. Gross value added (GVA) is the measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or sector of an economy. In national accounts GVA is output minus
  intermediate consumption; it is the value generated by any unit engaged in the production of goods and services. The manufacturing sector is defined in accordance with UK standard industrial classification of economic activities. The UK standard industrial classification of economic
  activities, abbreviated as UK SIC, is a 5-digit classification providing the framework for collecting and presenting a large range of statistical data according to economic activity. The current UK standard industrial classification of economic activities was completed in 2007 and
  effective from 01/01/2008.
