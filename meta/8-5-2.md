  The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the underutilization of the labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is
  thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often
  coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.

  <p>Unemployment measures people of age 16 and over without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks. The unemployment rate is the proportion of all employed and unemployed people (not the proportion of
  the total population) who are unemployed.</p><p>Disability Status - The <a href="https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/measuring-disability-for-the-equality-act-2010/">(GSS) harmonised "core" definition</a> identifies a person as disabled if they have a physical or mental health
  condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more. It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not
  disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for
  Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain</p>

  Due to the COVID19 pandemic, all face-to-face interviewing for the Labour Force Survey was suspended and replaced with telephone interviewing. This change in mode for first interviews has changed the non-response bias of the survey, affecting interviews from March 2020 onwards. More
  information can be found <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/coronavirusanditsimpactonthelabourforcesurvey/2020-10-13"> in an article on the ONS website</a>. Estimates presented in this chart for Q1 and Q2 2020 have
  been reweighted to account for this bias.

  <p>Special note - the estimates in this table from 2013 onwards are not directly comparable with those from earlier years. This is because there was a change in the reporting behaviour of survey respondents at the start of 2013 related to a change in the wording of the survey

  <p>The figures for unemployment and economically active individuals are measured for the ages 16 and above.</p><p>Nationality is available alongside country of birth from the source (see Sources tab).</p><p>The Washington Group on Disability Statistics are often used to provide a cross-
  nationally comparable population-based measures of disability. Please see the article <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/disability/articles/measuringdisabilitycomparingapproaches/2019-08-06">Measuring disability - comparing approaches</a>
  for a comparison between the GSS Harmonised measure (used here) and the Washington Group measure.</p> <p>For not seasonally adjusted data, it is best practice to only compare the same quarter for different years (e.g., compare January-March 2018 with January-March 2019 but do not compare

Some of the data in this indicator are seasonally adjusted data. The purpose of seasonal adjustment is to remove systematic calendar-related variation associated with the time of the year, that is, seasonal effects. This allows comparisons between consecutive time periods. Not all data is seasonally adjusted - disability and country of birth are not, and non-seasonally adjusted headline figures of unemployed people aged 16 and over are included as well as non-seasonally adjusted disaggregated data for age and sex. Seasonally adjusted figures are the headline figures, non-seasonally adjusted are for reference when using the disaggregations which have not been seasonally adjusted.
