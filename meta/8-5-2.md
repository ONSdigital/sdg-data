indicator: 8.5.2
indicator_name: 8.5.2 Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
national_indicator_available: Unemployment rate by sex, age and disability status 
national_indicator_description: >-
  The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the underutilization of the labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is
  thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often
  coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.

source_other_info_2: Special note - the estimates in this table from 2013 onwards are not directly comparable with those from earlier years. This is because there was a change in the reporting behaviour of survey respondents at the start of 2013 related to a change in the wording of the survey questionnaire.

Some of the data in this indicator are seasonally adjusted data. The purpose of seasonal adjustment is to remove systematic calendar-related variation associated with the time of the year, that is, seasonal effects. This allows comparisons between consecutive time periods. Not all data is seasonally adjusted - disability, country of birth and nationality figures are not, and non-seasonally adjusted headline figures of unemployed people aged 16 and over are included as well.<br><br> Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[8.5.2 Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities (CSV 548.921 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/8-5-2.csv)
