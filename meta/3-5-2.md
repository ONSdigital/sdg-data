  export, and sales data often via taxation. Numerator - The amount of recorded alcohol consumed per capita (15+ years) during a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol. Denominator - Midyear resident population (15+ years) for the same calendar year, UN World Population Prospects, medium

  Recorded alcohol per capita (15+) consumption of pure alcohol is calculated as the sum of beverage-specific alcohol consumption of pure alcohol (beer, wine, spirits, other). In order to make the conversion into litres of pure alcohol, if beverage volumes are not available in litres of
  pure alcohol, the alcohol content (% alcohol by volume) is considered to be as follows - Beer (barley beer 5%), Wine (grape wine 12%, must of grape 9%, vermouth 16%), Spirits (distilled spirits 40%, spirit-like 30%), and Other (sorghum, millet, maize beers 5%, cider 5%,  fortified wine
  17% and 18%, fermented wheat and fermented rice 9%, and other fermented beverages 9%). Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
