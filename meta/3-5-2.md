  Harmful use of alcohol, defined according to the national context as alcohol per capita consumption (aged 15 years and older) within a calendar year in litres of pure alcohol. Total alcohol per capita consumption (APC) is defined as the total (sum of recorded APC three-year average and
  unrecorded APC) amount of alcohol consumed per adult (15+ years) over a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol. Recorded alcohol consumption refers to official statistics at country level (production, import, export, and sales or taxation data), while the unrecorded alcohol consumption
  refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental control, such as home or informally produced alcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol, surrogate alcohol (which is alcohol not intended for human consumption), or alcohol obtained through cross-
  border shopping (which is recorded in a different jurisdiction). In circumstances in which the number of tourists per year is at least the number of inhabitants, the tourist consumption is also taken into account and is deducted from the country's recorded APC. The data on the number of
  tourists is from UN Tourist Statistics.

  Numerator - The sum of the amount of recorded alcohol consumed per capita (15+ years), average during three calendar years, in litres of pure alcohol, and the amount of unrecorded alcohol per capita consumption (15+ years), during a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol. Denominator -
  Midyear resident population (15+ years) for the same calendar year, UN World Population Prospects, medium variant.
