  <p>Headline data - (Government revenue / GDP) * 100</p><p>Disaggregated data -  (Revenue source/ GDP) * 100</p><p>Total government revenue is calculated by adding the total revenue of central and local governments, but excluding the "Current grants from central government" that flow into
  the local government sector (see disaggregations for details). This avoids double counting for the total government figures.
