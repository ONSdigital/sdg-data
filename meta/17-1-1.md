  <p>Definitions based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014</p>
  <p>Revenue is an increase in net worth resulting from a transaction. It is a fiscal indicator for assessing the sustainability of fiscal activities.</p>
  <p>Taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts
  receivable by government units from institutional units.</p>
  <p>Social contributions are actual or imputed revenue receivable by social insurance schemes to make provision for social insurance benefits payable.</p>
  <p>Grants are transfers receivable by government units from other
  resident or non-resident government units or international organizations, and that do not meet the definition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution.</p>
  <p>Other revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes, social contributions, and grants. It comprises (i) 
  property
  income, (ii) sales of goods and services, (iii) fines, penalties, and forfeits, (iv) transfers not 
  elsewhere classified, and (v) premiums, fees, and claims related to non-life insurance and standardised 
  guarantee schemes.</p>
