  contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which more than 12,000 global sites have
  been identified. Whilst Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are a good surrogate for general biodiversity, birds now comprise less than 50% of the species used to identify KBAs, expanding to <a
