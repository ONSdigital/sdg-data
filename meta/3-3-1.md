  Some rates have been suppressed to eliminate the risk of deductive disclosure (numerator <5 and denominator <10,000). Secondary masking has been undertaken where necessary. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with
  topic experts.

These data present information on the rate (per 100,000 population) of people newly diagnosed with HIV in the UK by year of diagnosis, country of residence and demographic characteristics. Due to the relatively low incidence of HIV in the UK, a rate per 100,000 population is used rather than the UN specified rate per 1,000 population. Since the duration between HIV infection and diagnosis is often unknown, new diagnoses cannot be used as a direct measure of HIV incidence.<br><br>Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[3.3.1 Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key populations (CSV 315.554 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/3-3-1.csv)
