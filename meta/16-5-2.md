  1. Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics. 2. Due to small numbers, any differences should be interpreted with caution. For the period October 2016 to March 2019, 38 of the 43 territorial forces in England and Wales provided data covering these crimes. It’s
  not possible to say whether the other 5 forces recorded crimes of this type but didn’t provide information or simply didn’t record any such crimes as none were reported.

source_other_info_1:   These experiemental statistics are based on police recorded crime. As with other types of crime, it is recognised that the recorded crime series will not provide a good measure of the full extent of criminality as not all offences come to the attention of the police. Therefore data
  should be treated with caution.
