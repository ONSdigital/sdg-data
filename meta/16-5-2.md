  <p>These statistics are based on police recorded crime. As with other types of crime, it is recognised that the recorded crime series will not provide a good measure of the full extent of criminality as not all offences come to the attention of the police. Therefore data should be
  treated with caution.</p><p>Quarters follow the calendar year beginning in January (Q1) and ending in December (Q4).</p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator
  specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
