  Seats refer to the number of parliamentary mandates, also known as the number of members of parliament. Seats are usually won by members in general parliamentary elections. Seats may also be filled by nomination, appointment, indirect election, rotation of members and by-election.
computation_calculations: The proportion of seats held by women in national parliament is derived by dividing the total number of seats occupied by women by the total number of seats in parliament. There is no weighting or normalising of statistics.

  1) Data for the House of Commons are only available for the general election years. 2) In 1974 there were two General elections in February (labelled a) and October (labelled b). 3) Data for the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly are calculated at
  the beginning of an assembly, and do not take into account changes during the course of that assembly. This also applies for Local Authority areas. Years on graph axis represent years in which any election was held. 4) The x-axis is not spaced evenly by year.

The data shows the percentage of women who hold seats in national parliament, devolved parliaments and assemblies, and local authority councils for all countries of the UK. 
The data are presented in nine categories. The House of Commons and House of Lords are representative of the entirety of the UK. In contrast, the data for local authority councillors are separated by country as are the devolved parliament and assembly seats of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 

•	Since 1918, when women were first permitted to stand as MPs, the UK has had a total of 491 elected female members to the House of Commons (up to end of August 2019).

•	Until 1997 there had never been more than 10% of seats held by women. Data for 2017 shows that 32% of seats in the House of Commons were occupied by female MPs, a record high.

•	Of the 782 members of the House of Lords in 2017, 206 were women, making up 26%. 

•	Since its devolution in 1999, the Welsh Government has consistently had at least 40% female Assembly Members. 

•	Women have made up between 30-40% of seats in the Scottish Parliament since 1999. In 2016 the figure stood at 35%.

•	Northern Ireland’s female Assembly Members rose from 13% in 1998 to 30% in 2017.
