data_footnote: >-
  <p> As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in October 2015, when the World Bank adopted $1.90 as the international poverty line
  using the 2011 PPP. Prior to that, the 2008 update set the international poverty line at $1.25 using the 2005 PPP. </p> <p>Please note the y axis does not go to 100% for ease of visualisation.</p>

  For the main UK data series on low income households see the Households below average income (HBAI) statistics. Please note that the HBAI statistics should not be compared to those living under the international poverty line, however they may give a more representative view of low income
  households in the United Kingdom.  Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
