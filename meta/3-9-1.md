  Fraction of annual all-cause adult mortality attributable to anthropogenic (human-made) particulate air pollution (measured as fine particulate matter, PM2.5). Mortality burden associated with long-term exposure to anthropogenic particulate air pollution at current levels, expressed as
  the percentage of annual deaths from all causes in those aged 30+. PM2.5 means the mass (in micrograms) per cubic metre of air of individual particles with an aerodynamic diameter generally less than 2.5 micrometers. PM2.5 is also known as fine particulate matter.

  Background annual average PM2.5 concentrations for the year of interest are modelled on a 1km x 1km grid using an air dispersion model, and calibrated using measured concentrations taken from background sites in Defra’s Automatic Urban and Rural Network (http://uk-
  air.defra.gov.uk/interactive-map.) Data on primary emissions from different sources and a combination of measurement data for secondary inorganic aerosol and models for sources not included in the emission inventory (including re-suspension of dusts) are used to estimate the
  anthropogenic (human-made) component of these concentrations. By approximating LA boundaries to the 1km by 1km grid, and using census population data, population weighted background PM2.5 concentrations for each lower tier LA are calculated. This work is completed under contract to
  Defra, as a small extension of its obligations under the Ambient Air Quality Directive (2008/50/EC). Concentrations of anthropogenic, rather than total, PM2.5 are used as the basis for this indicator, as burden estimates based on total PM2.5 might give a misleading impression of the
  scale of the potential influence of policy interventions (COMEAP, 2012).

  An increase of 10 ug/m3 in population-weighted annual average background concentration of PM2.5* is assumed to increase all-cause mortality rates by a unit relative risk (RR) factor of 1.06. For a population-weighted modelled annual average anthropogenic background PM2.5 concentration x,
  RR is calculated as (1.06)(x/10) (COMEAP, 2010). The fraction of deaths attributable to PM2.5 is expressed as a percentage, calculated as 100*(RR-1)/RR. Population-weighted annual average concentrations of anthropogenic PM2.5 were provided by AEA for all lower tier and unitary LAs within
  England. These were combined to produce figures at upper tier, regional and national level so that attributable fractions can be calculated at those scales also. The 2011 data for Cornwall and Isles of Scilly have been combined.

other_info: This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
