available_disaggregations: Speed - Between 2011 and 2017, figures for 'Between 2 mbps and 10 mbps' include connections under 2mbps, however these numbers are estimated to be marginal.
computation_calculations: >-
  Rate per 100 population is calculated as fixed broadband subscribers divided by the population estimate and multiplied by 100 - the calculations are performed by ITU and reported by the United Nations Statistics Division through the Global SDG Database. The population estimates used by
  ITU are taken from [UN Population Division World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/)

  On the Global database, navigate with the drop down options to Goal 17-> Target 17.6-> Indicator 17.6.1, and select the appropriate metric with the tick box. Then, from the Geographic Area tab at the top de-select ALL and navigate to World->Europe->Northern Europe-> United Kingdom
  (select the tick box). Finally, choose "Show table" or "Download" from the options above the tabs.

  ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire to national regulatory authorities, in the case of the UK this is <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/home">Ofcom</a>. The disaggregated data up to 2018 is available from Source 1 (UN Global Database) and the latest
  figure for the headline measure is obtained from Source 2 (ITU). <br><br> The indicator fixed Internet broadband subscriptions, by speed, refers to the number of fixed-broadband subscriptions to the public Internet, split by advertised download speed. Fixed Internet broadband
  subscriptions refer to subscriptions to high-speed access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This includes cable modem, DSL, fibre-to-the-home/building, other fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions, satellite broadband
  and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. This total is measured irrespective of the method of payment. It excludes subscriptions that have access to data communications (including the Internet) via mobile-cellular networks. It should include fixed WiMAX and any other fixed wireless
  technologies. It includes both residential subscriptions and subscriptions for organizations. <br> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
