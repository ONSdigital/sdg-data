  <p>Figures are for deaths registered, rather than deaths occurring in each calendar year. Due to the length of time it takes to complete a coroner's inquest, it can take months or even years for a suicide to be registered.</p><p>The large increase seen in Northern Ireland between 2004
  and 2006 coincides with a change to the Coroners’ Service. Prior to April 2006, there were seven Coroners’ districts in Northern Ireland. Following a review of the Coroners’ Service, the separate districts were amalgamated into one centralised Coroners’ Service.</p><p> Please note, data
  from 2019 and onwards represent suicides for England and Wales only and not UK. For more recent suicide statistics for other UK nations please see <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/deaths/suicides"> NRS Scotland</a> and

#### In **2021**… 
* In 2021, there were 5,224 suicides registered in England and Wales, equivalent to an age-standardised mortality rate of 10.7 deaths per 100,000 people and statistically significantly higher than the 2020 rate of 10.0 deaths per 100,000 people. It was consistent with the pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic rates in 2019 and 2018.
* The fall in the [suicide rate in 2020](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsfromsuicidethatoccurredinenglandandwales/apriltodecember2020) was likely to have been driven by a decrease in male suicides at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and delays in death registrations because of the pandemic.
* Around three-quarters of suicides were males (4,129 deaths; 74.0%), consistent with long-term trends, and equivalent to 16.0 deaths per 100,000, the rate for females was 5.5 deaths per 100,000.
* Among females, the age-specific suicide rate was highest in those aged 45 to 49 years (7.8 deaths per 100,000), while among males it was highest in those aged 50 to 54 years (22.7 deaths per 100,000).
* Females aged 24 years or under have seen the largest increase in the suicide rate since our time series began in 1981.
* In 10 out of the 11 previous years, London has had the lowest suicide rate of any region of England (6.6 deaths per 100,000), while the highest rate was in the North East with 14.1 deaths per 100,000 in 2021.
