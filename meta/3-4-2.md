  <p>Suicide – These data follow the National Statistics definition of suicide, which is based on codes from the International Classification of Diseases. See the three paragraphs below for the details of deaths that are included in UK data on suicide.</p><p> - All deaths that were
  assigned the underlying cause of ‘intentional self-harm for persons aged 10 years and above’ (ICD-9 code: E950 - E959 for deaths registered between 1981 and 2000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and between 1981 and 1999 in Scotland. ICD-10 code: X60 - X84 for deaths registered

data_footnote: >-
  Suicide rates per 100,000 population have been age-standardised to allow comparison between populations which may contain different proportions of people of different ages. Suicide rates by age are based on age-specific suicide rates per 100,000 population. Age-specific rates are
  calculated where there are fewer than 20 deaths are potentially unreliable. These figures are denoted with a 'u' in Source 1. Rates were not calculated where there were fewer than 3 death registrations. Data from 2019 and onwards is for Enlgand and Wales only.

  <p>Figures are for deaths registered, rather than deaths occurring in each calendar year. Due to the length of time it takes to complete a coroner's inquest, it can take months or even years for a suicide to be registered.</p><p>The large increase seen in Northern Ireland between 2004
  and 2006 coincides with a change to the Coroners’ Service. Prior to April 2006, there were seven Coroners’ districts in Northern Ireland. Following a review of the Coroners’ Service, the separate districts were amalgamated into one centralised Coroners’ Service.</p><p> Please note, data
  from 2019 and onwards represent suicides for England and Wales only and not UK. For more recent suicide statistics for other UK nations please see <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/deaths/suicides"> NRS Scotland</a> and

  in collaboration with topic experts.

#### In **2018**… 
* There were 6,507 suicides registered in the UK, an age-standardised rate of 11.2 deaths per 100,000 population; the latest rate is significantly higher than that in 2017 and represents the first increase since 2013.
* Three-quarters of registered deaths in 2018 were among men (4,903 deaths), which has been the case since the mid-1990s.
* The UK male suicide rate of 17.2 deaths per 100,000 represents a significant increase from the rate in 2017; for females, the UK rate was 5.4 deaths per 100,000, consistent with the rates over the past 10 years. 
* Scotland had the highest suicide rate in GB with 16.1 deaths per 100,000 persons (784 deaths), followed by Wales with a rate of 12.8 per 100,000 (349 deaths) and England the lowest with 10.3 deaths per 100,000 (5,021 deaths).
* Males aged 45 to 49 years had the highest age-specific suicide rate (27.1 deaths per 100,000 males); for females, the age group with the highest rate was also 45 to 49 years, at 9.2 deaths per 100,000.
* Despite having a low number of deaths overall, rates among the under 25s have generally increased in recent years, particularly 10 to 24 year old females where the rate has increased significantly since 2012 to its highest level with 3.3 deaths per 100,000 females in 2018.
