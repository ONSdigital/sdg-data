**Non Statistical Indicator**

Education in the UK is devolved, meaning school premises in each country of the UK are governed by different pieces of legislation. The legislation for each devolved administration below sets out the minimum standards for school premises against parts (a), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this indicator. As these are legal requirements in the UK it is assumed the proportion of schools meeting the indicator requirements for these parts of the indicator would be at, or very close to 100%. We are continuing to work to source data for the full indicator. 

<strong>England</strong>

All existing  and new schools maintained by a local authority are assessed against [The School Premises Regulations 2012]( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1943/contents/made). Independent schools are assessed against [The Education Independent Schools Standards Regulations 2010]( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/1997/contents/made). In March 2015 the Department for Education published [Advice on Standards for School Premises]( https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/410294/Advice_on_standards_for_school_premises.pdf) covering both these pieces of legislation. This covers standards for toilet and washing facilities, water supplies, lighting, and facilities for disabled pupils. 

<strong>Northern Ireland</strong>

The [School Building Handbook]( https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/articles/school-design-standards#toc-0) provides advice and guidance on the planning and design of new school buildings and the standard to which they should conform when designing new school accommodation. 

<strong>Scotland</strong>

School premises in Scotland are governed by [The School Premises General Requirements and Standards Regulations 1967](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1967/1199/pdfs/uksi_19671199_en.pdf). This legislation covers sanitary and washing accommodation, water supplies and lighting. In 2017 the Scottish Government conducted a [consultation]( https://www.gov.scot/publications/updating-school-premises-general-requirements-standards-scotland-regulations-1967-analysis/pages/2/) for updating this legislation. 

<strong>Wales</strong>

School premises in Wales are governed against [The Education School Premises Regulations 1999]( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2/contents/made). This sets out requirements for washroom facilities, water supplies and lighting in schools in Wales.
