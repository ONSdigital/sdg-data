**Non-statistical indicator**

This, or part of this, indicator is classified as Tier 3 and therefore no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available, but methodology or standards are being (or will be) developed or tested. Until methodology or standards have been agreed we are reporting/linking to the most relevant source of information.

The United Kingdom, with Australia, has released the ‘[Climate Finance Roadmap](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/climate-finance-roadmap-to-us100-billion)’ to report on developed countries' progress towards mobilising US$100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020. The Roadmap aims to provide increased predictability and transparency about how the goal will be reached, and sets out the range of actions developed countries will take to meet it.

The UK has pledged to [provide £5.8bn of climate finance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-climate-finance) between 2016/17 and 2020/21. This is an increase on the £3.87bn pledged between 2011/12 to 2015/16.
