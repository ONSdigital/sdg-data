computation_calculations: >-
  Age specific fertility rates are calculated by dividing the number of live birth to mothers in each age group by the mid-year female population. Rates for women aged 10 to 14 are calculated using the female population aged 10 to 14, while rates for women aged 15 to 19 are calculated
  using the female population aged 15 to 19. Rates for women under 20 are calculated using the sum of the female population aged 10 to 14, and the sum of the female population aged 15 to 19.

The very small number of live births in Scotland where the age of the mother was not stated have been proportionately distributed across the ages based on Scottish data for
  that year.

  For the 10 to 14 age group, rates were calculated using births to mothers aged 14 and under, as this was the most detailed data available, and therefore could potentially include births to mothers aged under 10. The potential number of these births cannot be revealed for confidentiality
  reasons. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
