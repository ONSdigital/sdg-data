This, or part of this, indicator is classified as Tier 3 and therefore no internationally established methodology or standards are yet available, but methodology or standards are being (or will be) developed or tested. Until methodology or standards have been agreed we are reporting/linking to the most relevant source of information.

This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator and has been identified in collaboration with topic experts. We will work to develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.

Data availability within the UK is limited to England for this indicator.

The Sustainable Development Goals is a collaborative project, if you have any feedback or suggestions for data please contact us at <SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk>
