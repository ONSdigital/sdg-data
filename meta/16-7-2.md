  1. Table excludes respondents who answered 'don't know' and those with missing answers. 2. Figures for 'Black' and 'Other' ethnic groups for 2014/15 are suppressed because the percentage is based on 5 or fewer responses and is therefore unavailable. 3. Information about respondents'
  limiting long term illnesses/disabilities are only available for those who completed the online version of the survey. 4. Citizenship - Respondents were instructed to select all that apply so there will be some overlap between citizenship groups. 5. Household income is measured as
  respondent income combined with the income of cohabiting partner (where applicable) from all sources before deductions. Response categories changed in 2016/17 and the 'no income' category was removed. It's likely that those with no income will have selected 'under £5,199' from 2016/17
  onwards. The household income categories are defined in the 'other information' section.

  We are reporting on data from 2013/14 as the data collection mode (from face-to-face to online/paper) changed and data would not be comparable with earlier years. From 2013/14 to 2015/16, household income categories were - Band A1 - Under £5,000; Band A2 - £5,000 to £9,999; Band A3 -
  £10,000 to £14,999; Band A4 - £15,000 to £19,999; Band A5 - £20,000 to £29,999; Band A6 - £30,000 to £49,999; Band A7 - £50,000 to £74,999; Band A8 - £75,000 or more. From 2016/17 onwards, the household income categories were changed to - Band B1 - Under £5,199; Band B2 - £5,200 to
  £10,399; Band B3 - £10,400 to £15,599; Band B4 - £15,600 to £20,799; Band B5 - £20,800 to £31,199; Band B6 - £31,200 to £51,999; Band B7 - £52,000 to £74,999; Band B8 - £75,000 or more.  This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will
  work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
