national_indicator_available: Completion rate for primary and lower secondary education is used. For upper secondary education completion rate a proxy for GCSE attainment at KS4 (in state-funded schools) is used.

computation_units: Percentage (%)
computation_definitions: >-
  <p>Primary and lower secondary education completion rate is measured as the gross intake ratio to the last grade of lower primary/secondary education. It is calculated as the number of new entrants (enrollments minus repeaters) in the last grade of primary/lower secondary education,
  regardless of age, divided by the population at the entrance age for the last grade of primary/lower secondary education.</p><p>GCSE attainment is the percentage of pupils achieving grade 4/C or above in English and maths GCSEs in state-funded schools.</p>
computation_calculations: >-
  No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this proxy indicator. For insight into the details of potential calculations please refer to the original source methodology information.
reporting_status: complete
data_non_statistical: false
data_footnote: <p>Primary and Lower secondary completion rates do not adjust for students who drop out during the final year of education. Thus this rate is a proxy that should be taken as an upper estimate of the actual completion rate.</p>

  <p>There are many reasons why the primary and lower secondary completion rate can exceed 100 percent - the numerator may include late entrants and overage children who have repeated one or more grades of primary education as well as children who entered school early, while the
  denominator is the number of children at the entrance age for the last grade of primary education.</p> <p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, summer exams were cancelled in 2020. Pupils scheduled to sit GCSE and A/AS level exams in 2020 were awarded either a centre assessment grade or
  their calculated grade using a model developed by Ofqual. The new method of awarding grades has led to a set of pupil attainment statistics that are unlike previous years. As a result the 2019/20 data should not be directly compared to attainment data from previous years for the purposes
  of measuring changes in student performance and, therefore, are not presented on the 'upper secondary education' graph. For more information please visit <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/key-stage-4-performance-revised/2019-20">DfE KS4
  2019/20</a></p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
