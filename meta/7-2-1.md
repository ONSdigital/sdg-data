  Renewable energy consumption includes consumption of energy derived from hydroelectric power, wind, wave, tidal, solar photovoltaic, geothermal aquifers, landfill gas, sewage gas, biogas from autogen, municipal solid waste, poultry litter, straw, wood, charcoal, liquid bio-fuels,
  bioethanol, biodiesel and biomass.
computation_calculations: This indicator is calculated by dividing consumption of energy from all renewable sources by total final energy consumption.

  In the UK there are two measures of renewable energy consumption, an Environmental Accounts figure produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and a Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES) figure produced by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The
  DUKES statistics are used to monitor the UK’s progress against the EU Renewable Energy Directive.  The ONS National Accounts statistics are compliant with the definitions of the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounting. The ONS statistic is calculated on a residency basis, whereas
  the DUKES figure is calculated on a territory basis.  This means the ONS statistic uses data relating to UK residents and UK-registered businesses, regardless of whether they are based in the UK or overseas.  This makes the ONS statistic comparable to other National Account statistics,
  for example, GDP, as well as other SDG indicators, for example, 7.3.1 Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP.  For this reason, the ONS figures have been displayed here. You can find the DUKES dataset produced by BEIS <a
  href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digest-of-uk-energy-statistics-dukes">here</a>.  The ONS also produce a bridging table to aid with comparisons between the two measures, which can be found <a
  href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalaccountsenergybridging">here</a>. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
