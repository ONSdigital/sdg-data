computation_units: Percentage (%)
computation_definitions: >-
  The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources. Renewable energy consumption includes consumption of energy derived from hydroelectric power, wind, wave, tidal, solar photovoltaic, geothermal
  aquifers, landfill gas, sewage gas, biogas from autogen, municipal solid waste, poultry litter, straw, wood, charcoal, liquid bio-fuels, bioethanol, biodiesel and biomass.
computation_calculations: >-
  No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of the headline United Kingdom figures as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator. However for type of renewable energy these have been calculated by the formula (Energy by renewable
  source/Total energy consumption of primary fuels and equivalents)*100

  In the UK there are two measures of renewable energy consumption, an Environmental Accounts figure produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and a Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES) figure produced by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The
  DUKES statistics are used to monitor the UK’s progress against the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The ONS National Accounts statistics are compliant with the definitions of the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounting. The ONS statistic is calculated on a residency basis, whereas
  the DUKES figure is calculated on a territory basis. This means the ONS statistic uses data relating to UK residents and UK-registered businesses, regardless of whether they are based in the UK or overseas. This makes the ONS statistic comparable to other National Account statistics, for
  example, GDP, as well as other SDG indicators, for example, 7.3.1 Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP. For this reason, the ONS figures have been displayed here.  The    [DUKES publication](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digest-of-uk-energy-statistics-
  dukes) is annually produced by BEIS. The ONS also produce a [bridging table](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalaccountsenergybridging) to aid with comparisons between the two measures. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This
  indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
