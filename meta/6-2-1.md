  Tertiary treatment - treatment (additional to secondary treatment) of nitrogen and/or phosphorus and/or any other pollutant affecting the quality or a specific use of water (microbiological pollution, colour etc.). The different possible treatment efficiencies (organic pollution removal
  of at least 95% for BOD, 85% for COD, nitrogen removal of at least 70%, phosphorus removal of at least 80%, and microbiological removal) cannot be added and are exclusive.
  Secondary treatment - treatment of (urban) wastewater by a process generally involving biological treatment with a
  secondary settlement or other process, resulting in a BOD removal of at least 70% and a COD removal of at least 75%.
  Primary treatment - treatment of (urban) wastewater by a physical and/or chemical process involving settlement of suspended solids, or other process in which the BOD5 of
  the incoming wastewater are reduced by at least 20% before discharge and the total suspended solids of the incoming wastewater are reduced by at least 50%.

data_footnote: Data refer to the financial year (April to March) until 2000. Independent treatment in 2012 is estimated by assuming that there are 2 persons per property.

  A framework for measuring faecal waste flows and safety factors has been developed and piloted in 12 countries (World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, 2014), and is being adopted and scaled up within the sanitation sector. This framework has served as the basis for indicators 6.2.1 and
  6.3.1. Data on safe disposal and treatment are not available for all countries. However, sufficient data were available to make global and regional estimates of safely managed sanitation services in 2017. Presence of a handwashing station with soap and water does not guarantee that
  household members consistently wash hands at key times, but has been accepted as the most suitable proxy. Data were available for 70 countries in 2017. At present, UK data does not account for homeless rough sleepers. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator
  has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
