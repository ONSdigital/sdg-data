  <p>Missing migrants are pressumed to be dead. 
  
</p><p>
 The count excludes deaths occuring in immigration detention facilities or after deportation to a migrantâ€™s homeland, as well as deaths more loosely connected with migrants irregular status, such as those resulting from labour
  exploitation. Migrants who die or go missing after they are established in a new home are also not included in the data, so deaths in refugee camps or housing are excluded.  The deaths of internally displaced persons who die within their country of origin are also excluded.
</p><p>
The
  data uses a range of sources to collate figures for missing and dead migrants;  incidents are ranked on a scale from 1-5 based on the source(s) of information available.
<p><li>level 1 -  only one media source
 <li> level 2 - from uncorroborated eyewitness accounts or data from survey
  respondents 
  <li>level 3 -  multiple media reports</li>
     <li>level 4 - at least one NGO, IGO, or another humanitarian actor with direct knowledge of the incident
  <li>level 5 -  official sources such as coroners, medical examiners, or government officials or from  multiple
  humanitarian actors</li>
