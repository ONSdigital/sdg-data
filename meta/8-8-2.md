  <p>Freedom of association and collective bargaining rights - The principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining (FACB) are and have long been at the core of the ILO’s normative foundations. These foundations have been established in the ILO’s Constitution (1919), the ILO
  Declaration of Philadelphia (1944), in two key ILO Conventions (namely the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98)) and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental
  Principles and Rights at Work (1998). They are also rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and other international and regional human rights instruments. With the adoption of the 1998 ILO Declaration, the promotion and realization of these fundamental
  principles and rights also became a constitutional obligation of all ILO member States.</p><p>

  <p>Data collection for this indicator is carried out by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and is based on the coding of relevant textual sources against a list of evaluation criteria (see Table 1 of the <a
  href='https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_648636.pdf'>Resolution concerning the methodology of the SDG indicator 8.8.2 on labour rights</a> publication) and then converting the coding into indicators. The method makes use of six
  ILO textual sources - </p><p>Reports of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations</p><p>Reports of the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards</p><p>Country Baselines Under the ILO Declaration Annual Review</p><p>Representations under
  Article 24 of the ILO Constitution</p><p>Complaints under Article 26 of the ILO Constitution</p><p>Report on the Committee on Freedom of Association</p><p>For non-ratifying countries, the method also codes relevant national legislation with the goal to offset information asymmetries
  between ratifying and non-ratifying countries as regards FACB rights in law. Ratifying countries are defined as those that have ratified both Conventions 87 and 98, in which case its national legislation is not coded. Non-ratifying countries, on the other hand, fall into two categories,
  those that have ratified neither 87 nor 98 and those that have ratified only one of these Conventions. If a country has ratified only 87, its national legislation is coded for violations pertaining to 98, as violations under 87 fall under the remit of the ILO’s Committee of Experts as
  well as Committee on the Application of Standards. Similarly, if a country has ratified only 98, its national legislation is coded for violations pertaining to 87. Note that for federal states, only federal-level legislation is coded.</p><p>The coding of national legislation is carried
  out in close collaboration with the International Labour Office to ensure that it is done in a manner consistent with the ILO’s supervisory system. In addition, countries may also make available information on national legislation when reporting on this indicator through Voluntary
  National Reports or national reporting platforms or any other national reports.</p><p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
