There is a strong and growing user need for better statistics on food insecurity in the UK. The Department for Work and Pensions now include a suite of food insecurity questions developed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on the Family Resources Survey (FRS), with first results expected in 2021. In the meantime, data presented here come from the Food and You Survey run by the Food Standards Agency which includes questions from the USDA food insecurity suite, with data available for England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

In 2018, 10% of respondents to the Food and You Survey reported living in a household with low or very low food security. These proportions are at similar levels to Wave 4 (2016).<br><br>Select the following link to download this indicator data in an accessible format:<br>[2.1.2 Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population, based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) (CSV 28.608 kB)](https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/sdg-data/data/2-1-2.csv)
