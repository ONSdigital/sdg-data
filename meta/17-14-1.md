other_info: >-
  The achieved score for each category was judged based on various information from the linked sources (see Sources tab). In some cases the sources provide exact information, such as details for dedicated budgets towards various programmes and projects, which provides a score towards
  category 1. Institutionalized political commitment synthesised generic information (see UN metadata for a detailed breakdown of scoring within each category). In other cases the linked sources provide an initial starting point and specific named policies can be followed up (available in
  footnotes within the documents) to find out the required information. The Agenda 2030 and the Voluntary National Review sources summarise most of the main contributions towards the policy coherence categories, and provide information that can be followed up for more detail. The Single
  Departmental Plans sources provide more specific information on how individual UK government departments have embedded the Goals. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
