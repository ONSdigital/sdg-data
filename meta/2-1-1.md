  Undernourishment is defined as the condition by which a person has access, on a regular basis, to the amount of food that are insufficient to provide the energy required for conducting a normal, healthy and active life, given his or her own dietary energy requirements. Though strictly
  related, “undernourishment” as defined here is different from the physical conditions of
  “malnutrition” and “undernutrition” as it refers to the condition of insufficient intake of food, rather than
  to the outcome in terms of nutritional status

  Up until 2016 to 17, Data is available as a combined figure from two survey years.  Each survey year spans two calendar years.  The year shown on the x-axis refers to the middle year from the combined survey years.  For example for year 2015 on the x axis, data is combined from both the
  2014 to 15 and the 2015 to 16 survey years. For Survey years between 2016 to 17 and 2018 to 19, data is combined from three survey years. For these survey years 2018 appears on the x-axis
