  Development Assistance Committee (DAC) - A unique international forum of many of the largest funders of aid, including 30 DAC Members. The World Bank, IMF and UNDP participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA) - The DAC defines <a href=
  'http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm'>ODA </a>as “those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local
  governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated
  at a rate of discount of 10 per cent). <a href= http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf'>Other official flows (OOF)</a> (para 24) (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the
  conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional. Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes
  aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid -  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral
  Organisations.  Purpose Codes - The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector
  classification codes used can be found on the <a href= 'http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm'>OECD website.</a>
computation_calculations: The codes used to measure net ODA to the clean and renewable energy sector sit under CRS codes 23210, 23220, 23230, 23240, 23250, 23260 and 23270 as defined by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Metadata for Indicator 7.a.1.
