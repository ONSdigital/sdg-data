national_indicator_description: >-
  The UN specification requires the total frows from ODA and Other Official Flows (OOF), which is not available here.  The flows covered by OOF are defined as all additional loans, grants and equity investments received by developing countries. These additional flows cover the same
  technologies and other activities (research and development, technical assistance, etc.) as listed in the CRS codes but exclude all flows extracted from the OECD/ CRS codes. The reported indicator only covers the ODA part, so it us likely an underestimation.

  <p>Official Development Assistance (ODA) - Resource flows to developing countries and multilateral organisations provided by official agencies (e.g. the UK Government) or their executive agencies. Each transaction is administered for the promotion of the economic development and welfare
  of developing countries and is concessional in character. More information on ODA can be found on the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm">OECD website</a>. ODA
  recipients are broken down in groups according to their Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.<p>Country income classification - The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of countries eligible to receive ODA is based on Gross National Income per capita as published by the <a
  href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD">World Bank</a>. All low and middle income countries are included, with the exception of G8 members, EU members, and countries with a firm date for entry into the EU. The list also includes all Least Developed Countries (LDCs) as
  defined by the <a href = "https://www.un.org/ohrlls/content/least-developed-countries%20">United Nations (UN)</a>.<p>LDCs - Least Developed Countries<p>LMICs - Lower-middle Income Countries<p>UMICs - Upper Middle Income Countries<p>Other LICs - Other Low Income Countries<p>Undefined -

  The codes used to measure net ODA to the clean and renewable energy sector sit under Sector Purpose codes (CRS codes) 23210, 23220, 23230, 23240, 23250, 23260 and 23270 as defined by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Metadata for Indicator 7.a.1. The net ODA across these
  seven CRS codes is summed for the headline UK data. These sums are broken down into the different country income classifications outlined in the definitions. The CRS code field and other relevant disaggregations are available from the Data Underlying SID spreadsheets linked in Source 1.
