  <p>For details of the Crime Survey for England and Wales, see the <a href='https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology'>user guide to crime statistics for England and Wales.</a></p><p>The year format refers to the two years
  covered by the data, from April of the first year to March of the following year. For example, 2018/19 covers the period of April 2018 to March 2019.</p><p>For further information on the quality of the estimates please refer to the source data which provides the unweighted base sizes of
  the samples. The sample size is lower between 2010/11 and 2012/13, and between 2017/18 and 2018/19 due to use of a split-sample experiment in these years. The methodological note titled <a href='http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160106010543/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-
  method/method-quality/specific/crime-statistics-methodology/methodological-notes/split-sample-for-intimate-personal-violence-2013-14.pdf'>Split sample for intimate personal violence 2013-14</a> provides further information.</p><p>New questions were introduced into the survey in 2010/11
  and were further revised for the survey year 2012/13. Estimates from 2012/13 onwards are calculated using these new questions. Estimates for earlier years are calculated from the original questions with an adjustment applied to make them comparable to the new questions.</p><p>The
  definition of disability used is consistent with the core definition of disability under the Equality Act 2010. A person is considered to have a disability if they have a long-standing illness, disability or impairment which causes difficulty with day-to-day activities.</p> This
  indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
