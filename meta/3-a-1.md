  Data for additional disaggregations are available in source 1, including data for smoking prevalence in English counties, smoking prevalence in English Clinical Commissioning Groups and Welsh Local Health Boards, smoking prevalence by economic activity, smoking prevalence by relationship
  status and smoking prevalence by highest educational attainment. Note that smoking prevalence by economic activity is only for ages 18 to 64. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the
  global indicator specification. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
