In some cases the sources provide exact information, such as details for dedicated budgets towards various programmes and projects, which provides a score towards the category on Institutionalized political commitment synthesised generic information (see UN metadata for a detailed breakdown of scoring within each category). In other cases the linked sources provide an initial starting point and specific named policies can be followed up (available in footnotes within the documents) to find out the required information. The Agenda 2030 and the Voluntary National Review sources summarise most of the main contributions towards the policy coherence categories, and provide information that can be followed up for more detail. The Single Departmental Plans sources provide more specific information on how individual UK Government departments have embedded the Goals. More specific links how different Government departments are committed to each goal can be found in the [Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/implementing-the-sustainable-development-goals/implementing-the-sustainable-development-goals--2) corporate report. This indicator will be updated every two years, but there may be in-between revisions introduced if more accurate data is established. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-04-28","national_data_updated_date":"2021-12-16","graph_limits":[{"unit":"Percentage (%)","minimum":0,"maximum":100}],"target_number":"17.14","goal_number":"17"}
