Migrants will be included within these population estimates. Estimates try to indicate behaviour by exact age 18 and by exact age 17 and do not take into account; death, divorce or migration which could occur by age 24. </p> <p>For 2014 marriage statistics onwards, ever married will include people entering into a marriage with either an opposite sex or a same sex partner. Same sex couples converting their civil partnership into a marriage will be included with ever married because previous marital status is unknown; therefore within this table we are assuming a previous marital status (before civil partnership) of never married or civil partnered.  </p> <p> From 27 February 2023, the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Minimum Age) Act 2022 came into effect. This act raised the age of marriage and civil partnership to 18 in England and Wales. This means that people aged 16 to 17 years are no longer able to marry or enter a civil partnership under any circumstances, including with parental or judicial consent from this date. </p>  This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
