Estimates try to indicate behaviour by exact age 18 and by exact age 17 and do not take into account; death, divorce or migration which could occur by age 24. </p> <p>For 2014 marriage statistics onwards, ever married will include people entering into a marriage with either an opposite sex or a same sex partner. Same sex couples converting their civil partnership into a marriage will be included with ever married because previous marital status is unknown; therefore within this table we are assuming a previous marital status (before civil partnership) of single, never married or civil partnered.  </p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.
