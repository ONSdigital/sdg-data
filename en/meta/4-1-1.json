Furthermore, the summer exams were cancelled in 2020. Pupils scheduled to sit GCSE and A/AS level exams in 2020 were awarded either a centre assessment grade or their calculated grade using a model developed by Ofqual. The new method of awarding grades has led to a set of pupil attainment statistics that are unlike previous years. As a result the 2019/20 data should not be directly compared to attainment data from previous years for the purposes of measuring changes in student performance and, therefore, are not presented on this graph.
