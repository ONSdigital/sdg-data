Furthermore, the summer exams were cancelled in 2020. Pupils scheduled to sit GCSE and A/AS level exams in 2020 were awarded either a centre assessment grade or their calculated grade using a model developed by Ofqual. The new method of awarding grades has led to a set of pupil attainment statistics that are unlike previous years. As a result the 2019 to 2020 data should not be directly compared to attainment data from previous years for the purposes of measuring changes in student performance and, therefore, are not presented on this graph.
