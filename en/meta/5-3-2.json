The World Health Organisation defines the four types of female genital mutilation as follows -\nType 1 - Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans (the external and visible part of the clitoris, which is a sensitive part of the female genitals, with the function of providing sexual pleasure to the woman), and/or the prepuce/clitoral hood (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoral glans).\nType 2 - Partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without removal of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva).\nType 3 - (Often referred to as infibulation). Narrowing of the vaginal opening with the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora. The covering of the vaginal opening is done with or without removal of the clitoral prepuce/clitoral hood and glans (Type I FGM).\nType 4 - All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization.","computation_calculations":"(Number of individuals with identified FGM/ Number of Women) * 100%","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"1.

Please note that individuals refers to all patiens in the reporting period where FGM was identified or a procedure for FGM was undertaken, and that therefore the year in which the case of FGM is reported may not be the same as the year in which FGM took place. In order to create percentages, mid-year estimates have been used from the year that covers the majority of the FGM reporting year; i.e. for the FGM reporting year 2014/15, 2014 mid-year estimates of population have been used.  This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.
