Coastal sites in the indicator are split between \u2018on-land\u2019 and \u2018at-sea\u2019 if they cross the mean high water mark.  At-sea extent includes offshore marine protected areas out to the limit of the UK continental shelf.</p><p>Extent is based on the following site designations - Areas of Special Scientific Interest, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, National Nature Reserves, Marine Conservation Zones, Nature Conservation Marine Protected Areas, Ramsar Sites, Special Areas of Conservation (including candidate Special Areas of Conservation and Sites of Community Importance), Special Protection Areas, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Scenic Areas, National Parks. </p><p>Many protected areas in the UK cover the same physical parcels of land, but for different reasons; as a result the designation types can overlap.  For example, it is possible for an individual site to be designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Special Area of Conservation (SAC), Special Protection Area (SPA), Ramsar site and National Nature Reserve (NNR), and could also be part of a National Park, an AONB (Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty) or National Scenic Area (NSA).</p>","computation_calculations":"No calculations on the source data were required.
