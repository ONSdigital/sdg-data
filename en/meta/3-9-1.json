Mortality burden associated with long-term exposure to anthropogenic particulate air pollution at current levels, expressed as the percentage of annual deaths from all causes in those aged 30+. PM2.5 means the mass (in micrograms) per cubic metre of air of individual particles with an aerodynamic diameter generally less than 2.5 micrometers. PM2.5 is also known as fine particulate matter. Within the CSV, Local Authority is comprised of Counties and Unitary Authorities.","computation_calculations":"Background annual average PM2.5\u00a0concentrations for the year of interest are modelled on a 1km x 1km grid using an air dispersion model, and calibrated using measured concentrations taken from background sites in Defra\u2019s Automatic Urban and Rural Network (http://uk- air.defra.gov.uk/interactive-map.) Data on primary emissions from different sources and a combination of measurement data for secondary inorganic aerosol and models for sources not included in the emission inventory (including re-suspension of dusts) are used to estimate the anthropogenic (human-made) component of these concentrations. By approximating LA boundaries to the 1km by 1km grid, and using census population data, population weighted background PM2.5\u00a0concentrations for each lower tier LA are calculated. This work is completed under contract to Defra, as a small extension of its obligations under the Ambient Air Quality Directive (2008/50/EC). Concentrations of anthropogenic, rather than total, PM2.5\u00a0are used as the basis for this indicator, as burden estimates based on total PM2.5\u00a0might give a misleading impression of the scale of the potential influence of policy interventions (COMEAP, 2012).","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"Please note the y axis does not go to 100% for ease of visualisation.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Fraction of all-cause adult mortality attributable to ambient anthropogenic particulate air pollution (measured as fine particulate matter, PM2.5)","data_show_map":true,"data_keywords":"map","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) and Air Pollution and Climate Change Group Public Health England (COMEAP)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2010,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"England","source_url_1":"https://data.england.nhs.uk/dataset/phe-indicator-30101","source_url_text_1":"3.01 Fraction of mortality attributable to particulate air pollution","source_release_date_1":"05/10/2017","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_other_info_1":"An increase of 10 ug/m3 in population-weighted annual average background concentration of\u00a0PM2.5* is assumed to increase all-cause mortality rates by a unit relative risk (RR) factor of 1.06.

Population-weighted annual average concentrations of anthropogenic PM2.5 were provided by AEA for all lower tier and unitary LAs within England. These were combined to produce figures at upper tier, regional and national level so that attributable fractions can be calculated at those scales also.
