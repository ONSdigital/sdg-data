The UK published its [sixth national report](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/united-kingdom-s-6th-national-report-to-the-convention-on-biological-diversity/) in March 2019.  This report showed the UK is on track to achieve 5 (25%) of the Aichi Targets by their deadlines. Progress is being made towards achieving 14 (70%) of the targets. There is 1 target that was not assessed. \n\nThis indicator relates to progress on achieving [Aichi Target 2](https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/), which the UK is on track to achieve by its deadline. We have incorporated biodiversity values into a range of planning, accounting and reporting systems including national natural capital asset and ecosystem service accounts, infrastructure development plans and in planning policies at national and local level on land and at sea. The countries of the UK have also established a range of country-based initiatives to support the achievement of Aichi Target 2. In England, the [National Planning Policy Framework](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/810197/NPPF_Feb_2019_revised.pdf) was amended to strengthen the protection for irreplaceable habitats and to make clear developments should provide biodiversity net gain. In Scotland, a [natural capital asset index](https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/planning-and-development/social-and-economic-benefits-nature/natural-capital-asset-index) has been published annually since 2011, measuring the quality and quantity of habitats according to their potential to deliver ecosystem services now into the future. Wales has introduced the [Well-being of Future Generations Act 2015](https://futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/) which brings biodiversity into the central decision-making process for public sector bodies in Wales.
