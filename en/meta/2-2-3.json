The anaemia prevalence for the population is used to classify the public health significance of the problem.","available_disaggregations":"Pregnancy status is a required disaggregation, but here we only present the data for non-pregnant women.

It negatively affects cognitive and motor development and work capacity, and among pregnant women iron deficiency anaemia is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, including preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia, but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes.","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-03-28","national_data_updated_date":"2022-03-18","graph_limits":[{"unit":"Percentage (%)","minimum":0,"maximum":100}],"target_number":"2.2","goal_number":"2"}
