Currently, there is no definitive source of data or suitable method available to accurately quantify the number of victims of offences that fall under modern slavery in the UK. The hidden nature of the crime makes producing an accurate prevalence measure difficult. Instead, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has brought together a range of available data sources on known victims and cases of modern slavery to provide a better understanding of the extent and nature of the crime. See the [Modern slavery in the UK - March 2020](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/modernslaveryintheuk/march2020) article and [appendix tables](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/modernslaveryintheukappendixtables) for the data.\n\n##### Key findings from the article include - \n* Greater awareness, increases in reporting and improvements in police recording are likely to have contributed to the increases seen in potential victim numbers in the UK since the introduction of the modern slavery Acts across the UK in 2015.\n* The number of potential victims referred through the UK National Referral Mechanism (NRM) increased by 36% to 6,985 in the year ending December 2018. Almost half of the referrals (45%) were potential victims aged under 18 years (see [Appendix table 1](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/modernslaveryintheukappendixtables)). (Source - Home Office \u2013 UK)\n* In the year ending June 2019, 55% of potential adult victims supported in England and Wales were female and 44% were male (see [Appendix table 36](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/modernslaveryintheukappendixtables)). The type of exploitation experienced varied by sex of victim. For example, in the year ending June 2019, domestic servitude and sexual exploitation were predominantly experienced by females (83% and 98% respectively), whereas labour exploitation was mostly experienced by males (86%) (see [Figure 7 of the article](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/modernslaveryintheuk/march2020) and [Appendix table 39](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/modernslaveryintheukappendixtables)).
