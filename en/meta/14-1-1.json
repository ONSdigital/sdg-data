Median counts based on fewer than 35 beaches are flagged as 'low reliability' in the download table (select 'Download Source CSV').</p><p>Number of volunteers has a complex relationship with litter count and is not controlled for in these figures. There is no clear overall pattern in volunteer numbers over time, however 2020 figures should not be compared with other years due to much lower volunteer numbers following covid regulations. Volunteer numbers for England and Northern Ireland are, in most years, higher than those in Wales and Scotland. This may have led to slightly higher litter counts in England and Northern Ireland than in Scotland and Wales. As such, comparisons of litter counts should not be made between countries (though overall trends may be compared). </p><p>Changes in which beaches are included each year, and differences in number of volunteers between years reduce our ability to draw conclusions about short term changes in litter counts, however longer term trends are robust.</p><p>The data presented here use the median of beach litter counts rather than the mean because of the distribution of the data (heavily right skewed with lots of outliers). Median counts of beach litter lead to lower estimates than the mean.</p><p>These data are for plastic- related items only, however the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) collect data on all litter,  which includes, for example, glass, cardboard, and ceramics.</p><p>Data collected in beach cleans that were over a different distance to 100m are not included in these estimates as this allowed for a more standardised measure.</p><p>Count of litter items does not include the category 'plastic/polystyrene pieces under 2.5cm' as small items are less likely to be seen, collected, and reported. In addition, they cannot be assigned a source.</p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.
