Based on this principle, a relevant disaggregation is most often defined as any classification that follows \"by\" in the title of the indicator, for example \"by age and sex\".  This working definition excludes cases where the title of the indicator includes sub-indicators, such as indicator 3.5.1 - \"Coverage of treatment interventions (pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services) for substance use disorders\" \u2013 treatment intervention is a sub-indicator rather than a disaggregation. Also, excluded are any references to the sample the indicator requires data for. For example indicator 5.3.1 - \"Proportion of women aged 20-24 years who were married or in a union before age 15 and before age 18\" \u2013 sex and age are not disaggregations, but the sample required by the indicator.","available_disaggregations":"Completeness of disaggregation and goal.","computation_calculations":"<p>Based on the definition above, 53 indicators were identified as containing specific disaggregations within the title. This number was used as the denominator for calculating the proportion of indicators with ahieved full or partial disaggregation. The number of reported indicators on the UK SDG platform that fully achieve the disaggregation identified in their title are divided by the total number of indicators identified to contain disaggregation in their title (53 indicators in total). The result is then multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. The same process is followed for indicators that have available data only for some of the disaggregations identified in the title, in order to obtain percentage of indicators with achieved partial disaggregation. The disaggregation by goal shows achieved percentage based on the number of relevant indicators within that goal.</p> <p>This method counts a proxy variable towards achieving a required disaggregation. For example, indicator 2.2.2 requires prevalence of malnutrition by type (wasting and overweight), which is achieved by using a classification by Body Mass Index (BMI) - obese, overweight, and underweight.</p> <p>Based on the outlined definition, Goals 6, 7 ,13, and 14 do not have any indicators that require disaggregations.</p>","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"The calculated numbers for 2020 are based on a denominator of 50 indicators that require diaggregation in the title.
