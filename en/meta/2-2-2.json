These are assessed based on WHO child growth standrds and BMI classifications, depending on data availability. Wasting type can be aligned with underweight BMI classifications. See Calculations and Other information sections for more details.</p><p> BMI is defined as weight (in kg) divided by height squared (in m2). For England, Scotland, and Wales, BMI classifications are defined using the British 1990 Growth Reference where underweight includes those with a BMI less than or equal to the 2nd centile, overweight includes those with a BMI of greater than or equal to the 85th and less than the 95th centile and obesity includes those with a BMI greater than or equal to the 95th centile. The exception is Wales who categorises underweight as those with a BMI less than (but not equal to) the 2nd centile. For Northern Ireland, BMI classifications are defined using the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) guidelines. For more information, please refer to the original source links in the Sources tab. <p/> <p> Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is the official measure of relative deprivation. It is expressed either in deciles (1 to 10) or quintiles (1 to 5), with 1 representing the most deprived category. It is calculated slightly differently between the different UK nations, so direct comparisons are not advised. For more details refer to the original source links in the Sources tab. For England, this variable is based on child residency post code, and for the WHO Child Growth Standards series entries without a post code were excluded from the analysis prior to the period 2021 to 2022. For the 2021 to 2022 school year the percentage for these entries is made available as \"Unable to categorise\". As a result, the total IMD sample number does not add up to the total sample size.</p><p>Rural/urban classification - the Urban variable includes all settlements with over 10,000 population. The Rural variable includes all settlements classed as town and fringe, village, and hamlet and isolated dwellings. This variable is based on child residency post code, so entries without a post code are described as \"Unable to categorise\".</p>","available_disaggregations":"<p> Sex; Index of Multiple Deprivation; Ethnic group; Urban or rural classification.
