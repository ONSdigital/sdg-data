Sexual violence for this data refers to any sexual violence, including attempts. </p><p>Disability Status - The <a href=\"https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/measuring- disability-for-the-equality-act-2010/\">(GSS) harmonised \"core\" definition</a> identifies a person as disabled if they have a physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more. It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The 'long-term health condition' category therefore includes both disabled and non-disabled people under this definition. The two sub-categories of non-disabled (GSS harmonised) are 'long-term health conditin - does not limit activities' and 'no long-term health condition'. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self- reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>","available_disaggregations":"<p>Physical violence - Violence type, Sex, Age, Ethnicity, Household income, Highest Qualification, Urban/Rural, Region, Disability status, Country of birth and Sexual orientation.</p><p>Sexual Violence - Violence type, Sex, Age, Ethnicity, Household income, Highest Qualification, Region, Disability status and Country of birth.
