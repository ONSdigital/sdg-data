Extent includes three components - the spatial extent or surface area, the quality, and the quantity of water-related ecosystems.</p><p>Open water body area - Area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. This includes the following 3 water-related ecosystem categories - rivers and estuaries, lakes, and artificial waterbodies. <p>Permanent water - Area that is under water throughout the year.</p><p>Seasonal water - Area that is under water for less than 12 months a year.</p><p>Ephemeral water -Area that is episodically under water in different years.</p><p>HydroBASINS - A series of polygon layers that depict watershed boundaries at a global scale. They use the Pfafstetter coding system, which allows for analysis of catchment topology. Catchments  can be broken down  into smaller sub-basins; with each subdivision, the Pfafstetter level increases. Here, a Pfafstetter level of 6 was used, giving us data for 38 catchments across the UK.</p><p>Lake water quality - Turbidity and trophic state of 22 UK water bodies. For the UK, this includes one estuary (the Humber Estuary)</p><p>Turbidity -  An indicator of water clarity, quantifying the haziness of the water and acting as an indicator of underwater light availability.</p><p></p>Trophic State - The degree to? which organic matter accumulates in the water body. Trophic state is most commonly used in relation to monitoring eutrophication.</p><p>Deviation level - Deviation in water quality from values measured over a five-year baseline (2006 to 2010) - Low (0 to 25%), Medium (25 to 50%), High (50 to 75%), and Extreme (75% to 100%).</p><p>Reservoir area - Area of artificial (or human-made) bodies of freshwater, as opposed to lakes which are naturally occurring.

However, the 'Open water area' series data has undergone further refinement to ensure costal water is not included in the estimate. Therefore, values differ to those on GSWE.

Anomalous years (likely due to cloud cover - 1994 to 1998 and 2004 to 2009) have therefore been excluded from the data presented here, with the exception of the baseline. The baseline period of 2001 to 2005 includes the anomalous years 2004 and 2005. To mitigate the impact of variable cloud cover, the modal value of each pixel across the baseline years has been used to calculate the average spatial extent in the baseline period. Further details on the source data and mitigating the impacts of these anomalous periods is provided in the <a href=\"https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/projects/quality- and-methodology-extent-and-change-of-surface-water-statistics\">Data Science Campus Quality and Methodology document</a>.</p><p>HydroBASIN catchments are identified with numbers, however we have added descriptive names to each catchment in the dropdown menu - these are not official names. Work is in progress to provide interactive maps. While these are not yet available here, they can be viewed in the blog <a href=\"https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/using-satellite-imagery-to-report-changes-to-water-bodies-for-sdg-6-6-1\">Using satellite imagery to report changes to water for SDG 6.6.1</a>.</p><p><b>Groundwater</b></p><p>Groundwater level data is obtained from BGS WellMaster database, derived from 154 groundwater level monitoring stations to provide groundwater estimates for 19 of the 34 HydroBasins in the UK. HydroBasin catchments are identified with numbers, however descriptive name have been added to the dropdown menu, these are not official names.</p><p>The chosen five-year reference period for the analysis is 1990 to 1994. Values greater than 100% imply average groundwater levels have risen since the period 1990 to 1994, while values less than 100% imply falling levels.</p><p>The data monitored by measuring authorities in each nation (EA, SEPA, NRW, DAERA) are passed to BGS periodically. All chosen sites have the following - monitoring frequencies of greater than one observation a month, are monitoring boreholes where groundwater levels are not systematically affected by abstraction, and are representative of local and regional groundwater systems.</p><p>Raw data is quality assured by measuring authority and are expected to be accurate to less than +/- 0.01 metre for data collected since 1990. On receipt by BGS an additional check is made to ensure all values fall within expected hydrogeologicaly plausible ranges.</p><p>Please note, the headline figure for UK show average percentage change across hydrobasins for which values are available (not all hydrobasins are represented), not the % change across hydrobasins.</p><p><b>Reservoir</b></p><p>It is recognised that reservoirs are not traditional water ecosystems that necessarily warrant protection and restoration, but many countries hold a noteworthy amount of freshwater and thus has been included. Thereby, including data on reservoirs countries can better understand changes occurring to artificial water bodies in conjunction with changes occurring to natural waterbodies.</p><p>The reservoirs dataset is derived from GSWE, with 2000 to 2004 being the chosen baseline period. See<a href=\"https://map.sdg661.app/\"> Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer</a> for further information.<p></p><b>Lake water quality</b></p><p>Turbidity is derived from suspended solids concentration estimated and tropphic state index comes from phytoplankton biomass by proxy of cholorphyll-a</p><p>The chosen baseline period is 2006 to 2010 and includes five monthly averages across the five years of observation for this period. From theses five years of data, 12 monthly averages (one for each month of the year) for trophic and turbidity were derived. A further set of observations were then used to calculate change from baseline. These monthly data comprise years 2017 to 2019. Lake quality percentages can be classified as; 0 to 25% (low), 25 to 50% (medium), 50 to 75% (high) and 75 to 100% (extreme). A lake is catergorised as being 'affected' when the value for turbidity/trophic state exceeds 50%, when compared to the lakes baseline value.</p><p>Products in period 2006 to 2010 are based on observations from the Meris sensor, whereas 2017 to 2019 used OCLI sensors. Most accurate water quality sensors have 250 to 350 metre resolutions, while less accurate sensors detect turbidity/trophic state changes to 100m resolution. Land/water buffer maps as well as ice maps were applied to improve accuracy of the data.</p><p>Please note, the data is not informing whether a lake is considered to be good/bad quality, only that a lake water event has occurred and been recorded. Also, turbidity and trophic state are an indirect indication for water quality, but do perform a successful proxy role.
