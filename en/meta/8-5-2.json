It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. As such, it is seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market.</p><p> Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search.</p>","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Labour Organization (ILO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=8&Target=8.5","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 8.5","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","computation_definitions":"<p>Unemployment measures people of age 16 and over without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks.

It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>","computation_calculations":"No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as the data were readily available in the required format from the source.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"<p>The population totals used for the latest LFS estimates use projected growth rates from Real Time Information (RTI) data for EU and non EU populations based on 2021 patterns.
