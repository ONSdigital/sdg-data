This is to ensure that the focus of the indicator is on tracking the publishing of sustainability information, rather than on the practice of publishing stand-alone sustainability reports.</p><p><b>Company</b> -  while many companies report at the group level, many of their impacts will be local, and some subsidiaries or franchises produce separate sustainability reports. As a practice that should be encouraged, and one that is useful to monitor, it is therefore proposed to count both the group and subsidiary/franchise level separately, as separate entities. \u201cCompany\u201d can therefore apply to either the parent company, or a franchise or subsidiary, depending on their reporting practices.</p>","available_disaggregations":"Activity","computation_calculations":"No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"sustainability; company","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"United Nations SDG Global database (UNSDG)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2016,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/database","source_url_text_1":"UN SDG Global database (UNSDG)","source_release_date_1":"10/07/2023","source_next_release_1":"See source link: We plan to update indicator data within 4 months of data being released","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official international","source_contact_1":"statistics@un.org","source_other_info_1":"Filter by goal and target, then select Country data = United Kingdom from the \"Select indicators\" field","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"12-06-01","other_info":"<p>The data displayed here is sourced from the SDG Global database.
