It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p><p>","computation_calculations":"No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"1. Table excludes respondents who answered 'don't know' and those with missing answers. 2. Figures for 'Black' and 'Other' ethnic groups for 2014/15 are suppressed because the percentage is based on 5 or fewer responses and is therefore unavailable. 3. Information about respondents' limiting long term illnesses/disabilities are only available for those who completed the online version of the survey. 4. Citizenship - Respondents were instructed to select all that apply so there will be some overlap between citizenship groups. 5. Household income is measured as respondent income combined with the income of cohabiting partner (where applicable) from all sources before deductions. Response categories changed in 2016/17 and the 'no income' category was removed. It's likely that those with no income will have selected 'under \u00a35,199' from 2016/17 onwards. The household income categories are defined in the 'other information' section.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of population agreeing they can influence decisions affecting their local area","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Community","expected_disaggregations":["Sex","Age","Disability status","Ethnicity","Citizenship"],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2013/14","source_geographical_coverage_1":"England","source_url_1":"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/community-life-survey--2","source_url_text_1":"Community Life Survey","source_release_date_1":"25/07/2019","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_contact_1":"evidence@culture.gov.uk","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":"2013/14","source_geographical_coverage_2":"England","source_url_2":"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/dcms-community-life-survey-ad-hoc-statistical-releases","source_url_text_2":"Feeling of being able to influence decisions affecting the local area by citizenship and household income","source_release_date_2":"03/09/2019","source_next_release_2":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official Statistic","source_contact_2":"evidence@culture.gov.uk","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"16-07-02","other_info":"<p>We are reporting on data from 2013/14 as the data collection mode (from face-to-face to online/paper) changed and data would not be comparable with earlier years.</p><p>From 2013/14 to 2015/16, household income categories were - Band A1 - Under \u00a35,000; Band A2 - \u00a35,000 to \u00a39,999; Band A3 - \u00a310,000 to \u00a314,999; Band A4 - \u00a315,000 to \u00a319,999; Band A5 - \u00a320,000 to \u00a329,999; Band A6 - \u00a330,000 to \u00a349,999; Band A7 - \u00a350,000 to \u00a374,999; Band A8 - \u00a375,000 or more.

The global metadata specified by the United Nations defines population group as a nationally relevant concept, encompassing \u201cgroups with a distinct ethnicity, language, religion, indigenous status, nationality or other characteristics\u201d. The currently available disaggregations by ethnicity and citizenship fall within \u201cpopulation group\u201d as defined by the global metadata, so this indicator is considered as fully disaggregated.</p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible, we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification.
