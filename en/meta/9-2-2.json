These estimates are sourced from the Labour Force Survey. The manufacturing sector has been defined in accordance with UK standard industrial classification of economic activities. For the nationality and country of birth figures, the European Economic Area (EEA) is defined as the 28 countries of the EU, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Swiss nationals are treated as EEA nationals for immigration purposes; however, for statistical purposes Switzerland is not included in EEA estimates by ONS unless otherwise specified. Other countries are defined in this publication as all countries other than the UK and those in the EEA.</p><p>Disability Status - The <a href=\"https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/measuring- disability-for-the-equality-act-2010/\">(GSS) harmonised \"core\" definition</a> identifies a person as disabled if they have a physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more. It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>","computation_calculations":"(Number of people employed in the manufacturing sector / Number of people in employment) * 100","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Manufacturing employment as a percentage of total employment","data_show_map":true,"data_keywords":null,"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Quarterly","source_earliest_available_1":1995,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/employmentbyindustryemp13","source_url_text_1":"Employment by industry","source_release_date_1":"18/02/2020","source_next_release_1":"19/05/2020","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"labour.market@ons.gsi.gov.uk","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_2":"NA","source_earliest_available_2":2009,"source_geographical_coverage_2":"United Kingdom","source_url_2":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/adhocs/009777manufacturingemploymentasapercentageoftotalemploymentbyvariouscharacteristicsuk2009to2017","source_url_text_2":"Manufacturing employment as a percentage of total employment by various characteristics, UK - 2009 to 2017","source_release_date_2":"22/03/2019","source_next_release_2":"NA","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_2":"The analysis uses the population weights for 2017 (PWT17).
