It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>","computation_calculations":"No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"Please note the y axis does not go to 100% for ease of visualisation.","graph_type":"line","graph_titles":[{"series":"Percentage of adults aged 16 to 59 (%)","title":"Percentage of adults age 16 to 59 who have experienced indecent exposure or unwanted sexual touching in the previous twelve months"},{"series":"Percentage of adults aged 16 to 74 (%)","title":"Percentage of adults age 16 to 74 who have experienced indecent exposure or unwanted sexual touching in the previous twelve months"}],"data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Crime, safety","expected_disaggregations":["Sex","Age","Disability status","Place of occurrence"],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2004/05","source_geographical_coverage_1":"England and Wales","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesannualsupplementarytables","source_url_text_1":"Crime in England and Wales - Annual supplementary tables","source_release_date_1":"17/07/2020","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"crimestatistics@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Data acquired from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (tables 41a to 42b).","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_2":"Adhoc","source_earliest_available_2":"2016/17","source_geographical_coverage_2":"England and Wales","source_url_2":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/adhocs/10458percentageofadultsaged16to59whowerevictimsofsexualassaultincludingattemptsinthelastyearbyselectedpersonalorhouseholdcharacteristicsandsexyearendingmarch2018csew","source_url_text_2":"Percentage of adults aged 16 to 59 who were victims of sexual assault (including attempts) in the last year","source_release_date_2":"02/09/2019","source_next_release_2":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_2":"National Statistic","source_contact_2":"crimestatistics@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_2":"Data acquired from the Crime Survey for England and Wales.
