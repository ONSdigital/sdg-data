Employed persons are all persons of working age who during a specified brief period, such as one week or one day, were in the following categories - i) paid employment (whether at work or with a job but not at work), or  ii) self-employment (whether at work or with an enterprise but not at work).

It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of managerial positions held by women","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Labour Force","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"NA","source_earliest_available_1":2012,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/adhocs/009741proportionofwomeninmanagerialpositionsuk2012to2017","source_url_text_1":"Proportion of women in managerial positions, UK - 2012 to 2017","source_release_date_1":"07/03/2019","source_next_release_1":"NA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_contact_1":"SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"The full list of who is defined as a manager is given in Annex 1 of the data source.","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"05-05-02","other_info":"<p>Disability status is only reported for ages 16 to 64 years.
