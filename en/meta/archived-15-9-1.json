The UK published its [sixth national report](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/united-kingdom-s-6th-national-report-to-the-convention-on-biological-diversity/) in March 2019.  This report showed the UK is on track to achieve 5 (25%) of the Aichi Targets by their deadlines. Progress is being made towards achieving 14 (70%) of the targets. There is 1 target that was not assessed. \n\nThis indicator relates to progress on achieving [Aichi Target 2](https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/), which the UK is on track to achieve by its deadline. We have incorporated biodiversity values into a range of planning, accounting and reporting systems including national natural capital asset and ecosystem service accounts, infrastructure development plans and in planning policies at national and local level on land and at sea. The countries of the UK have also established a range of country-based initiatives to support the achievement of Aichi Target 2. In England, the [National Planning Policy Framework](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/810197/NPPF_Feb_2019_revised.pdf) was amended to strengthen the protection for irreplaceable habitats and to make clear developments should provide biodiversity net gain. In Scotland, a [natural capital asset index](https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/planning-and-development/social-and-economic-benefits-nature/natural-capital-asset-index) has been published annually since 2011, measuring the quality and quantity of habitats according to their potential to deliver ecosystem services now into the future. Wales has introduced the [Well-being of Future Generations Act 2015](https://futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/) which brings biodiversity into the central decision-making process for public sector bodies in Wales.  \n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-08","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-04-08: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/d2e2ae9ffcd009625f62af4b5fa5ce012f610910","archive_type":"revised","permalink":"archived-indicators/15-9-1-archived","data_notice_class":"blank","data_notice_heading":"This is an <a href='https://sdgdata.gov.uk/archived-indicators'>archived</a> indicator","data_notice_text":"This indicator was revised following <a href='https://sdgdata.gov.uk/updates/2021/02/17/2020-indicator-changes.html'>indicator changes</a> from the United Nations 2020 Comprehensive Review.","indicator":"archived-15-9-1","target_id":"archived-15-9-1","sdg_goal":"archived-15-9-1","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"(a) Number of countries that have established national targets in accordance with or similar to Aichi Biodiversity Target 2 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\u20132020 in their national biodiversity strategy and action plans and the progress reported towards these targets; and (b) integration of biodiversity into national accounting and reporting systems, defined as implementation of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting"}
