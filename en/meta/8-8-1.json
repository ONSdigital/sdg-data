While 2019/20 falls largely outside of the pandemic period, disruption to data collection processes in early 2020 may also be a contributory factor to changes in data in 2019/20. Further, the employment data used to calculate rates includes those temporarily absent from work. In 2020/21 and (to a lesser extent) in 2021/22, the number of such workers was higher than previous years due to temporary employment schemes (e.g. furlough) introduced during the coronavirus pandemic. This has further contributed to the discontinuity in injury rates.
