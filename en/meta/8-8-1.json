Non-fatal injuries are additionally broken down by occupation.</p><p>For fatal injuries, country/region reflects the location of where the injury occurred; for non-fatal injuries country/region reflects the injured person\u2019s usual place of residence. It should be noted that country and regional differences in injury rates are strongly affected by differences in employment profiles.</p><p>Fatal injuries are available at a more disaggregated breakdown by age than non-fatal injuries.

Rates have been calculated in the source data by dividing the number of workers in the reference group with an injury (fatal or non-fatal) by the employment total.\u00a0 This is then multiplied by a factor of 100,000 to give a rate per 100,000 workers, in line with international standards.
