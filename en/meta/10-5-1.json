The data for this FSI are compiled in accordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III. </p><p>Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital - This FSI is calculated by taking the value of nonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as the denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital. </p><p>Nonperforming loans to total gross loans - This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the numerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions) as the denominator. </p><p>Return on assets - This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period. </p><p>Liquid assets to short-term liabilities - This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as the numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking the broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, this indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. </p><p>Net open position in foreign exchange to capital - The net open position in foreign exchange should be calculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital should be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.","computation_calculations":"Calculated figures provided by source.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"Values are rounded to 2dp.
