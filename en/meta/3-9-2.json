Data on deaths are also widely available from countries from death registration data or sample registration systems, which are certainly feasible systems. Such data are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in countries. The main limitation is that not all countries do have such registration systems to date, and data need to be completed with other type of information. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2020-07-03","national_data_updated_date":"2021-11-22","target_number":"3.9","goal_number":"3"}
