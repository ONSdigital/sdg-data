They are also rights proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and other international and regional human rights instruments. With the adoption of the 1998 ILO Declaration, the promotion and realization of these fundamental principles and rights also became a constitutional obligation of all ILO member States.</p><p>","computation_calculations":"No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.

The method makes use of six ILO textual sources: (1) Reports of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations; (2) Reports of the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards; (3) Country Baselines Under the ILO Declaration Annual Review; (4) Representations under Article 24 of the ILO Constitution; (5) Complaints under Article 26 of the ILO Constitution; (6) Report on the Committee on Freedom of Association.</p><p>For non-ratifying countries, the method also codes relevant national legislation with the goal to offset information asymmetries between ratifying and non-ratifying countries as regards FACB rights in law. Ratifying countries are defined as those that have ratified both Conventions 87 and 98, in which case its national legislation is not coded. Non-ratifying countries, on the other hand, fall into two categories, those that have ratified neither 87 nor 98 and those that have ratified only one of these Conventions. If a country has ratified only 87, its national legislation is coded for violations pertaining to 98, as violations under 87 fall under the remit of the ILO\u2019s Committee of Experts as well as Committee on the Application of Standards. Similarly, if a country has ratified only 98, its national legislation is coded for violations pertaining to 87.</p><p>The coding of national legislation is carried out in close collaboration with the International Labour Office to ensure that it is done in a manner consistent with the ILO\u2019s supervisory system. In addition, countries may also make available information on national legislation when reporting on this indicator through Voluntary National Reports or national reporting platforms or any other national reports.</p><p>Please note that although the data presented on this page are provided by the UN and match the <a href='https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=8&Target=8.8'>global metadata</a>, the data are estimated.</p><p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.
