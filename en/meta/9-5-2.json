It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"Headcount figures are of all full-time and part time employees whose self-reported main job is in research.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Researchers per 1,000,000 population","data_show_map":true,"data_keywords":"Labour Force, Population, map","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics","source_periodicity_1":"N/A","source_earliest_available_1":2012,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/adhocs/009826numberofresearchersintheuk2012to2017","source_url_text_1":"Number of researchers in the UK - 2012 to 2017","source_release_date_1":"04/04/2019","source_next_release_1":"N/A: We plan to update indicator data within 4 months of data being released","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_contact_1":"SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Figures are a headcount of all full-time and part time employees whose self-reported main job is in research.

One is provided on a full-time equivalency basis by the World Bank and follows the UN specification for this indicator.  This is displayed here as the headline data.  \n\nAnother measure is calculated using the Labour Force Survey by the Office for National Statistics using a headcount of both full-time and part-time workers.  The headcount figures are valuable, despite not following the UN specification, as they allow us to disaggregate by some of the Leave No-one Behind characteristics, for example, migratory and disability status.\n\nYou can switch between the two options below by using Units toggle on the left hand side.
