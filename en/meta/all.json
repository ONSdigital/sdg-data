Housing costs such as rent, Council Tax, mortgage payments etc. are excluded from the measure, meaning expenditure is counted on an \u2018after housing costs\u2019 (AHC)  basis. Household Income - The measure we use for income is household disposable income, AHC. Disposable income is the amount of money that households have available for spending and saving after direct taxes (such as Income Tax, National Insurance and Council Tax) and pension contributions have been accounted for. It includes earnings from employment, private pensions and investments as well as cash benefits provided by the state.

The LCF is an annual survey of the expenditure and income of private households; people living in hotels, lodging houses and institutions such as old people\u2019s homes are excluded. It is the only data source to collect detailed data on both income and expenditure, thereby allowing analysis of the two measures. As with all surveys, there are some limitations to be aware of. The LCF is known to not fully capture those at the poorest and richest ends of income distribution and suffers from non-response error . When analysing inequalities, this can impact on the representation of the target population (in this case, the bottom 40%) and the overall appearance of income distribution. In international comparisons, data has been sourced from the World Bank, and data for the UK comes from Eurostat\u2019s  European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). The EU-SILC collects data on poverty, income, social exclusion and living conditions. In the international analysis, the total population and the target population (bottom 40%) are defined on a household level, before housing costs (BHC). Eurostat sets the reference year at T-1 from the survey year, therefore 2009 reference year will refer to 2010 survey data. In addition, data from the World Bank is from 91 countries. Not all these countries will have annual surveys, therefore the reference years for the annualised growth rates are labelled at circa 2010 to 2015. The annualised growth rate is computed as - (mean in year 2/mean in year 1)^(1/(reference year 2 \u2013 reference year 1)). Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.

The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main components - i) Enabling environment - this includes the policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the \u2018enabling environment\u2019 for IWRM; ii) Institutions - includes the range and roles of political, social, economic and administrative institutions that help to support the implementation of IWRM; iii) Management Instruments - The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions; iv) Financing - Budgeting and financing made available and used for water resources development and management from various sources. The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main components (UNEP 2016). Each component is split into two parts - questions concerning the \u2018National level\u2019 and \u2018Other levels\u2019 respectively. \u2018Other levels\u2019 includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate.

The framework for delivering the Directive is through River Basin Management Planning. The UK has been split into several River Basin Districts. Each River Basin District has been characterised into smaller management units known as Water Bodies. The surface Water Bodies may be rivers, lakes, estuary or coastal.

It is assessed against the scale of high, good, moderate, poor and bad. The ecological status of surface waters is assessed according to the following criteria - Biological quality (measured by composition and abundance of specified elements such as fish, benthic invertebrates, aquatic flora); Hydromorphological quality (measured by reference to elements such as river continuity, channel patterns, dynamics of flow or substrate of the river bed); and Physico-chemical quality (measured by reference to elements such as temperature, oxygenation, pH, nutrient conditions and the concentrations of specific pollutants [synthetic and non-synthetic]). The chemical status of surface waters is assessed according to the following criteria - Chemical quality (measured by reference to environmental quality standards for chemical substances at European level). These standards specify maximum annual average concentrations for specific water pollutants. The specific requirements differ depending on which type of surface water body is being monitored. Chemical status is measured as either good or fail. If part of a water body fails on any one of the criteria monitored, it will fail to achieve or lose good status. This is described as the \"one out all out\" approach. The results published each year relate to data reported in that year under the WFD; data reported in a given year relate to data collected over the previous year (for Scotland) and previous 3 years (for England, Wales and Northern Ireland).","computation_calculations":"The percentage of water bodies in each status class has been calculated based on the total number of water bodies assessed in each year.

The introduction of new Water Framework Directive (WFD) monitoring data and classification standards (including a new baseline adopting all of the new standards, tools, designations and water body boundaries) in 2014 has led to a step change in the number of water bodies assessed as being in each status class in following years. The formal reporting of new standards in cycle 2 of WFD has used the second cycle plans published in 2015.  The introduction of reporting the cycle 2 standards has differed amongst the UK countries. The percentage of water bodies in each status class has been calculated based on the total number of water bodies assessed in each year. The number of water body assessments included varies slightly from year to year. The reductions in the number of assessments made in 2015 and 2016 were primarily due to Wales and then England adopting the monitoring and classification standards laid down in Cycle 2 of the WFD. This resulted in the removal of a number of water bodies that were below the 10km2 catchment area in line with WFD guidance. While data is available from 2009, it is not reported here because data from 2015 onwards are not directly comparable to those in earlier years.

The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main components - i) Enabling environment - this includes the policies, laws, plans and strategies which create the \u2018enabling environment\u2019 for IWRM; ii) Institutions - includes the range and roles of political, social, economic and administrative institutions that help to support the implementation of IWRM; iii) Management Instruments - The tools and activities that enable decision-makers and users to make rational and informed choices between alternative actions; iv) Financing - Budgeting and financing made available and used for water resources development and management from various sources. The indicator is based on a national survey structured around these four main components (UNEP 2016). Each component is split into two parts - questions concerning the \u2018National level\u2019 and \u2018Other levels\u2019 respectively. \u2018Other levels\u2019 includes sub-national (including provinces/states for federated countries), basin level, and the transboundary level as appropriate. These two parts address the wording of Target 6.5 \u2018implement [IWRM] at all levels \u2026\u2019. To further aid interpretation and comparison, the indicator results can be categorized in a similar way to the survey questions - Degree of implementation = Very low (0-9.9); Low (10-29.9); Medium-low (30-49.9); Medium-high (50-69.9); High (70-89.9); and Very high (90-100).","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":true,"graph_type":"line","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"DEFRA","source_active_1":false,"source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"06-05-02","other_info":"Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.

Many protected areas in the UK cover the same physical parcels of land, but for different reasons; as a result the designation types can overlap.  For example, it is possible for an individual site to be designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Special Area of Conservation (SAC), Special Protection Area (SPA), Ramsar site and National Nature Reserve (NNR), and could also be part of a National Park, an AONB (Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty) or National Scenic Area (NSA).","computation_calculations":"Total extent of protected areas at-sea is calculated using a program written by JNCC which uses a number of site designation files as input, and calculates a set of non-overlapping polygons for that entire set of designations for each year.

Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid -  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations. Purpose Codes - The DAC Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.

Missing income information is imputed. Disposable household income includes - all income from work (employee wages and self-employment earnings); private income from investment and property; transfers between households; all social transfers received in cash including old-age pensions. Note - Some of the income components are mandatory only from 2007 - Imputed rent, Interest paid on mortgage, Employer's social insurance contributions. From the 2007 year on, all countries have to supply gross income information. The current definition of total household disposable income used for the calculation of EU-SILC based indicators excludes - imputed rent (i.e. money that one saves on full [market] rent by living in one's own accommodation or in accommodation rented at a price that is lower than the market rent); non monetary income components, in particular value of goods produced for own consumption, social transfers in kind and non-cash employee income except company cars. At risk of poverty rate is defined at cut-off point - 50% of median equivalised income. Equivalence scale - to take into account the impact of differences in household size and composition, the total disposable household income is \"equivalised\". The equivalised income attributed to each member of the household is calculated by dividing the total disposable income of the household by the equivalisation factor. Equivalisation factors can be determined in various ways. Eurostat applies an equivalisation factor calculated according to the OECD- modified scale first proposed in 1994 - which gives a weight of 1.0 to the first person aged 14 or more, a weight of 0.5 to other persons aged 14 or more and a weight of 0.3 to persons aged 0-13. Household definition - A 'private household' means \"a person living alone or a group of people who live together in the same private dwelling and share expenditures, including the joint provision of the essentials of living\". EU-SILC implementing regulation number 1983/2003 on updated definitions, defines households in terms of sharing household expenses and (for non- permanent members) in terms of duration of stay and (for temporarily absent members) in terms of duration of absence.","computation_calculations":"Calculated figures provided by source.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Percentage of people in households at risk of poverty (below 50% of median UK household income)","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":null,"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Eurostat","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2005,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-datasets/-/ILC_LI02","source_url_text_1":"At-risk-of-poverty rate by poverty threshold, age and sex - EU-SILC survey","source_release_date_1":"17/12/2019","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-Official","source_contact_1":"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/help/support","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"10-02-01","other_info":"For further information please see eurostat Income and living conditions (ilc) @ http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/ilc_esms.htm Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.

The strategy covers all non-native species of flora and fauna with the exception of genetically modified organisms, bacteria and viruses.\n\nIn our [6th National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity](http://data.jncc.gov.uk/data/527ff89f-5f6b-4e06-bde6-b823e0ddcb9a/UK-CBD-6NR-v2-web.pdf), the UK report progress against Aichi Target 9 - by 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment of invasive alien species. The assessment concluded we were making progress towards the target but at an insufficient rate.\n\nThe report stated that - Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) are managed on a Great Britain and all-Ireland basis in the British Isles, with countries working closely together to co-ordinate their efforts. Priority species have been identified following extensive scientific review and expert input and a framework to prioritise their management have been developed. Comprehensive risk analysis processes are in place (including horizon scanning, risk assessment and risk management), as are new information systems and contingency plans to support rapid response. Despite strong action, currently the number of INNS established in Britain has remained constant, in terrestrial environments, and has increased in the freshwater and marine environment.  \n\nFurther information on the UK status against treaties and Action Plans, National Reports and National Legislation relating to invasive non-native species can be found on the [InforMEA](https://www.informea.org/en/countries/GB/parties) website.

Definitions sourced from \u201cIncome and Living Conditions\u201d Metadata (Eurostat). <br> <br> Household income - The total disposable income of a household is calculated by adding together the personal income received by all of household members plus income received at household level. Missing income information is imputed. <br> <br> Disposable household income includes i) All income from work (employee wages and self-employment earnings), ii) Private income from investment and property, iii) Transfers between households, iv) All social transfers received in cash including old-age pensions  Note - Some of the income components are mandatory only from 2007 - Imputed rent, Interest paid on mortgage, and v) Employer's social insurance contributions. From 2007 onwards, all countries have to supply gross income information. <br> The current definition of total household disposable income used for the calculation of EU-SILC based indicators excludes i) Imputed rent - i.e. money that one saves on full (market) rent by living in one's own accommodation or in accommodation rented at a price that is lower than the market rent, and ii) Non monetary income components, in particular value of goods produced for own consumption, social transfers in kind and non-cash employee income except company cars. <br> <br> Equivalence scale - To take into account the impact of differences in household size and composition, the total disposable household income is \"equivalised\". The equivalised income attributed to each member of the household is calculated by dividing the total disposable income of the household by the equivalisation factor. <br> <br> Equivalisation factors can be determined in various ways. Eurostat applies an equivalisation factor calculated according to the OECD-modified scale first proposed in 1994. This gives a weight of 1.0 to the first person aged 14 or more, a weight of 0.5 to other persons aged 14 or more and a weight of 0.3 to persons aged 0-13.","computation_calculations":"No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.

Many protected areas in the UK cover the same physical parcels of land, but for different reasons; as a result the designation types can overlap.

The World Bank, IMF and UNDP participate as observers. Official development assistance (ODA) - The DAC defines ODA as \u201cthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients and to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent) (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). Other official flows (OOF) - Other official flows (excluding officially supported export credits) are defined as transactions by the official sector which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as ODA, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they are not sufficiently concessional (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCDDAC(2016)3FINAL.pdf - Para 24). Bilateral Aid -  Bilateral aid covers all aid provided by donor countries when the recipient country, sector or project is known. Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid -  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations. Purpose Codes - The DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.  In addition, these codes are used to classify information in the DAC databases. The sector classification codes used can be found on the OECD website (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm). \u201cInternational cooperation and capacity-building support\u201d implies aid (most of it quantifiable) in the form of grants or loans by external support agencies. The amount of water and sanitation-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) can be used as a proxy for this, captured by OECD Creditor Reporting  System (CRS). ODA is defined as flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 per cent (using a fixed 10 per cent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (\u201cbilateral ODA\u201d) and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts, from a recipient perspective, comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export credit agencies\u2014with the pure purpose of export promotion\u2014is excluded (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). \u201cDeveloping countries\u201d refer to countries, which are eligible to receive official development assistance (http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm). This limits the scope of reporting to those countries receiving water and sanitation ODA, and the number of such countries is expected to decrease going forward. Water and sanitation-related activities and programmes include those for water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (targets 6.1, 6.2), wastewater and water quality (6.3), water efficiency (6.4), water resource management (6.5), and water-related ecosystems (6.6). As per target 6.a wording, it includes activities and programmes for water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies. A government coordinated spending plan is defined as a financing plan/budget for the water and sanitation sector, clearly assessing the available sources of finance and strategies for financing future needs.","computation_calculations":"The raw data underlying the United Kingdom Statistics on International Development was summed around appropriate aid description CRS codes, bilateral and multilateral classification, donor recipient countries, and type of aid codes.

A downward trend in the Red List Index over time means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. An upward Red List Index trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened species is on track. A Red List Index value of 1 would indicate that biodiversity loss has been halted.<p>The Red List Index reported here is based on global classifications for each species. In other words this Index does not indicate risk of extinction within the UK, but rather, risk of global extinction of species found within the UK.  <p>More detailed information on trends in UK Biodiversity, including information on the National Red List can be found in the <a href=\"https://nbn.org.uk/stateofnature2019/reports/\">State of Nature Report</a>.<p>The Red List Index is based on quantitative objective categories and criteria. To avoid spurious results from biased selection of species, the Red List Index is calculated from taxonomic groups for which all species have been assessed and reassessed, and, for taxonomic groups that that do not fulfil this criteria, species that are representatively sampled. Changes between categories reflect geniune improvement or deterioration in status, not as a consequence of changes in taxonomy or knowledge. <p>The Red List Index is calculated on an annual basis, however, this does not reflect re-assessment of all species, as species are not assessed every year.

Currently, there is no definitive source of data or suitable method available to accurately quantify the number of victims of offences that fall under modern slavery in the UK. The hidden nature of the crime makes producing an accurate prevalence measure difficult. Instead, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has brought together a range of available data sources on known victims and cases of modern slavery to provide a better understanding of the extent and nature of the crime. See the [Modern slavery in the UK - March 2020](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/modernslaveryintheuk/march2020) article and [appendix tables](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/modernslaveryintheukappendixtables) for the data.\n\n##### Key findings from the article include - \n* Greater awareness, increases in reporting and improvements in police recording are likely to have contributed to the increases seen in potential victim numbers in the UK since the introduction of the modern slavery Acts across the UK in 2015.\n* The number of potential victims referred through the UK National Referral Mechanism (NRM) increased by 36% to 6,985 in the year ending December 2018. Almost half of the referrals (45%) were potential victims aged under 18 years (see [Appendix table 1](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/modernslaveryintheukappendixtables)). (Source - Home Office \u2013 UK)\n* In the year ending June 2019, 55% of potential adult victims supported in England and Wales were female and 44% were male (see [Appendix table 36](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/modernslaveryintheukappendixtables)). The type of exploitation experienced varied by sex of victim. For example, in the year ending June 2019, domestic servitude and sexual exploitation were predominantly experienced by females (83% and 98% respectively), whereas labour exploitation was mostly experienced by males (86%) (see [Figure 7 of the article](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/modernslaveryintheuk/march2020) and [Appendix table 39](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/modernslaveryintheukappendixtables)).

Bilateral aid also includes aid that is channelled through a multilateral organisation where the government department determines the country, sector or theme that the funds will be spent on. Multilateral Aid -  This is aid delivered in the form of core contributions to organisations on the DAC List of Multilateral Organisations. Purpose Codes - The DAC Secretariat maintains various code lists which are used by donors to report on their aid flows to the DAC databases.

The DUKES statistics are used to monitor the UK\u2019s progress against the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The ONS National Accounts statistics are compliant with the definitions of the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounting. The ONS statistic is calculated on a residency basis, whereas the DUKES figure is calculated on a territory basis. This means the ONS statistic uses data relating to UK residents and UK-registered businesses, regardless of whether they are based in the UK or overseas. This makes the ONS statistic comparable to other National Account statistics, for example, GDP, as well as other SDG indicators, for example, 7.3.1 Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP. For this reason, the ONS figures have been displayed here. You can find the DUKES dataset produced by BEIS <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digest-of-uk-energy-statistics-dukes\">here</a>.

Missing income information is imputed.  <br> Disposable household income includes i) All income from work (employee wages and self-employment earnings), ii) Private income from investment and property, iii) Transfers between households, iv) All social transfers received in cash including old-age pensions  Note - Some of the income components are mandatory only from 2007 - Imputed rent, and Interest paid on mortgage, and v) Employer's social insurance contributions. <br> From 2007 onwards, all countries have to supply gross income information. <br> The current definition of total household disposable income used for the calculation of EU-SILC based indicators excludes i) Imputed rent - i.e. money that one saves on full (market) rent by living in one's own accommodation or in accommodation rented at a price that is lower than the market rent, and ii) Non monetary income components, in particular value of goods produced for own consumption, social transfers in kind and non-cash employee income except company cars.<br> <br> Equivalence scale - To take into account the impact of differences in household size and composition, the total disposable household income is \"equivalised\". The equivalised income attributed to each member of the household is calculated by dividing the total disposable income of the household by the equivalisation factor. <br> Equivalisation factors can be determined in various ways. Eurostat applies an equivalisation factor calculated according to the OECD-modified scale first proposed in 1994. This gives a weight of 1.0 to the first person aged 14 or more, a weight of 0.5 to other persons aged 14 or more and a weight of 0.3 to persons aged 0-13. <br> <br> Household - A 'private household' means \"a person living alone or a group of people who live together in the same private dwelling and share expenditures, including the joint provision of the essentials of living\". EU-SILC implementing regulation number 1983/2003 on updated definitions, defines households in terms of sharing household expenses and (for non-permanent members) in terms of duration of stay and (for temporarily absent members) in terms of duration of absence.
