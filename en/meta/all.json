The new method of awarding grades has led to a set of pupil attainment statistics that are unlike previous years. The 2021/22 academic year saw the return of the summer exam series. As part of the transition back to the summer exam series, adaptations were made to the exams (including advance information) and the approach to grading for 2022 exams broadly reflected a midpoint between results in 2019 and 2021. Given the unprecedented change in the way GCSE results were awarded in the summers of 2020 and 2021, as well as the changes to grade boundaries and methods of assessment for 2021/22, users need to exercise caution when considering comparisons over time, as they may not reflect changes in pupil performance alone. </p><p> For more information please visit <a href=\"https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/key-stage-4-performance-revised/2021-22\">DfE KS4 2019/20. </a></p> This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator.

The assessment concluded we were making progress towards the target but at an insufficient rate.\n\nThe report stated that - Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) are managed on a Great Britain and all-Ireland basis in the British Isles, with countries working closely together to co-ordinate their efforts. Priority species have been identified following extensive scientific review and expert input and a framework to prioritise their management have been developed. Comprehensive risk analysis processes are in place (including horizon scanning, risk assessment and risk management), as are new information systems and contingency plans to support rapid response. Despite strong action, currently the number of INNS established in Britain has remained constant, in terrestrial environments, and has increased in the freshwater and marine environment.  \n\nFurther information on the UK status against treaties and Action Plans, National Reports and National Legislation relating to invasive non-native species can be found on the [InforMEA](https://www.informea.org/en/countries/GB/parties) website.

Definitions sourced from \u201cIncome and Living Conditions\u201d Metadata (Eurostat). <br> <br> Household income - The total disposable income of a household is calculated by adding together the personal income received by all of household members plus income received at household level. Missing income information is imputed. <br> <br> Disposable household income includes i) All income from work (employee wages and self-employment earnings), ii) Private income from investment and property, iii) Transfers between households, iv) All social transfers received in cash including old-age pensions  Note - Some of the income components are mandatory only from 2007 - Imputed rent, Interest paid on mortgage, and v) Employer's social insurance contributions. From 2007 onwards, all countries have to supply gross income information. <br> The current definition of total household disposable income used for the calculation of EU-SILC based indicators excludes i) Imputed rent - i.e. money that one saves on full (market) rent by living in one's own accommodation or in accommodation rented at a price that is lower than the market rent, and ii) Non monetary income components, in particular value of goods produced for own consumption, social transfers in kind and non-cash employee income except company cars. <br> <br> Equivalence scale - To take into account the impact of differences in household size and composition, the total disposable household income is \"equivalised\". The equivalised income attributed to each member of the household is calculated by dividing the total disposable income of the household by the equivalisation factor. <br> <br> Equivalisation factors can be determined in various ways.

According to such a view, the prevalence of undernourishment could be simply computed by counting the number of individuals in a representative sample of the population that is classified as undernourished, based on a comparison of individual habitual food consumption and requirements.</p><p>Unfortunately, such an approach is not feasible for two reasons - first, due to the cost of individual dietary intake surveys, individual food consumption is measured only in a few countries, every several years, on relatively small samples; moreover, individual energy requirements are practically unobservable with standard data collection methods (to the point that observed habitual energy consumption of individuals in a healthy status is still the preferred way to infer individual energy requirements). This means that even if it were possible to obtain accurate observations of the individual dietary energy consumption, this would be insufficient to infer on the undernourishment condition at individual level, unless integrated by the observation on the physical status (body mass index) and of its dynamic over time, of the same individual.</p><p>The model-based approach, developed by FAO, and used to estimate the prevalence of undernourishment integrates information that is available with sufficient regularity from different sources for most countries in the world, in a theoretically consistent way, thus providing what is still one of the most reliable tools to monitor progress towards reducing global hunger.</p><p>However, data reliability mostly depends on the quality of the data used to inform the estimation of the model\u2019s parameters, which could be either from survey data or from food balances. Neither source is devoid of problems and, when comparing estimates from food balances and surveys, differences are frequently noted. To limit the impact of errors, FAO has traditionally presented estimates of prevalence of undernourishment at national level as three-year averages, on the presumption that errors induced by imprecise recording of stocks variations in each single year might be highly reduced when considering an average over three consecutive years.</p><p>Finally, due to the probabilistic nature of the inference and the margins of uncertainty associated with estimates  of each of the parameters in the model, the precision of the prevalence of undernourishment estimates is generally low. While it is not possible to formally compute margins of error around prevalence of undernourishment estimates, these are expected to likely exceed 5 percent in most cases. For this reason, FAO does not consider prevalence of undernourishment estimates that result to be lower than 2.5 percent as sufficiently reliable to be reported.</p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.

It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day- to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p><p>State Pension age - From 6 April 2010, the State Pension age has been increasing gradually for women, and since December 2018 has been increasing for both men and women. The data for 2019/20 were collected throughout the financial year 2019/20, during which the State Pension age for both men and women increased from 65 years 2 months to 65 years 8 months. The data for 2020/21 were collected throughout the financial year 2020/21, during which the State Pension age for both men and women increased to 66 years. The data for 2021/22 were collected throughout the financial year 2021/22, during which the State Pension age for both men and women remained at 66 years.</p><p>Highest qualification - Educational attainment is measured by the highest level of qualification achieved. England, Wales and Northern Ireland use a range from Entry Level to Level 8.

Level 1 includes qualifications such as GCSEs (grades 1-3/G-D) and Scottish National 4 qualifications. Level 2 includes qualifications such as GCSEs (grade 4/C and above) and Scottish National 5 qualifications. Level 3  includes qualifications such as A levels and Scottish Highers. Level 4 or higher covers a range of further education and university qualifications, including undergraduate degrees (such as BA, BSc, LLB), Master's degrees, doctoral qualifications (such as PhDs), most professional medical qualifications and PGCEs. No reported qualifications covers qualifications where the exact type or level could not be established during the interview.</p><p>Ethnic group - Sample sizes for 'Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller' are small, so for Northern Ireland, 'Irish Traveller' is included in 'Other ethnic group'. For England, Wales and Scotland, 'Gypsy or Irish Traveller' is included in 'White'.

Northern Ireland and total UK figures for percentage of forest area with a long-term management plan, and forest area annual net change prior to 2013 are not shown here, as estimates before the change in methodology are not directly comparable to those after.

It is assumed that the volume of deadwood per hectare is unchanged over time, and that all estimates per hectare for the UK are similar to GB levels. Growing stock estimates have been used to uprate GB biomass figures from the NFI report to UK figures and to derive a time series.</p><p>More information on biomass can be found in the Forestry Commission publication on <a href=\"https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/publications/biomass-in-live-woodland-trees-in-britain/\">Biomass in live woodland trees in Britain</a>.</p><h3>Protected areas</h3><p>For Great Britain, the woodland area within legally protected areas has been estimated by overlaying the National Forest Inventory woodland map with maps of designated areas. Geological Sites of Special Scientific Interest have been excluded from this analysis, as the designation in these cases is unlikely to be related to the presence of woodland. A similar analysis was undertaken by the Northern Ireland Forest Service for the Forest Resources Assessment 2015.</p><h3>Long-term management plans</h3><p>All Forestry England, Forestry and Land Scotland, Natural Resources Wales, and Forest Service woodland from 2000 is assumed to have a long- term management plan. For private sector woodland, the area of woodland with a long-term management plan has been estimated from data held in administrative systems for Grants & Regulations, or for areas of certified woodland (if this is larger). This is likely to undercount the true level of woodland with a long-term management plan.</p><h3>Independently verified management certification schemes</h3><p>Forestry certification schemes are owned by national or international non-governmental organisations and exist to promote good forest practice. They offer product labels to demonstrate that wood or wood products come from well-managed forests. Certified woodland areas are based on the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) scheme, the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) scheme and (since 2020) the Grown in Britain (GiB) scheme. Many woodlands are certified under more than one scheme. Further details can be found in the <a href=\"https://cdn.forestresearch.gov.uk/2023/06/PWS-statsnotice-15jun23.pdf\">Provisional Woodland Statistics 2023</a>.<p>Where possible, figures are for the woodland area certified, rather than the land area certified.

Based on this principle, a relevant disaggregation is most often defined as any classification that follows \"by\" in the title of the indicator, for example \"by age and sex\".  This working definition excludes cases where the title of the indicator includes sub-indicators, such as Indicator 2.5.2 - \"Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or at unknown level of risk of extinction\" \u2013 risk level is a sub-indicator rather than a disaggregation. Also, excluded are any references to the sample the indicator requires data for, such as Indicator 5.3.1 - \"Proportion of women aged 20-24 years who were married or in a union before age 15 and before age 18\" \u2013 sex and age are not disaggregations, but the sample required by the indicator.","computation_calculations":"Based on the definition above, across all goals 50 indicators were identified as containing specific disaggregations within the title. This number was used as the denominator for calculating the proportion of indicators with full disaggregation. The number of reported indicators on the UK SDG platform that fully achieve the disaggregation identified in their title are divided by the total number of indicators identified to contain disaggregation in their title (that is, 50). This number is then multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage of indicators with full disaggregation across all goals. The same process is followed for indicators that have available data only for some of the disaggregations identified in the title, in order to obtain percentage of indicators with achieved partial disaggregation. Likewise for indicators that require disaggregation in the title, but no data is available on the platform. In addition, a proxy variable counts towards achieving a required disaggregation. For example indicator 2.2.2 requires prevalence of malnutrition by type (wasting and overweight), which is achieved by using a classification by Body Mass Index (BMI) - obese, overweight, and underweight.\nWhen the data is additionally disaggregated by goal, the percentage represents the completeness of disaggregation (fully, partially, not disaggregated) based on the number of indicators identified to require disaggregation within that particular goal, rather than the total 50 indicators across all goals. Based on the outlined definition, Goals 6, 7 ,13, and 14 do not have any indicators that require disaggregation.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"bar","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":null,"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2020,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"UK","source_url_1":"https://sdgdata.gov.uk/","source_url_text_1":"UK data for the Sustainable Development Goals","source_statistical_classification_1":"Experimental","source_contact_1":"SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"All the data used for calculating the reported proportions is sourced from the indicators information available on the UK SDG platform","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"17-18-01","other_info":"The data reported here represents a snapshot from the end of the particular year.

It is ONS practice not to calculate rates where there are fewer than 3 deaths in a cell, as rates based on such low numbers are susceptible to inaccurate interpretation. These values have been left blank and are flagged as 'Missing value; suppressed' in the observation status of the downloadable csv. Some figures shown have low reliability (rates based on between 3 and 19 deaths). This means that their reliability as a measure may be affected by the small number of events. Information on reliability is given in the observation status column in the downloadable csv. In particular, late neonatal figures have low reliability for some birthweights and some country of birth levels. See available disaggregations above for more information. </p><p>Breakdowns by birthweight, sex, mother's country of birth and age are only given where deaths could be linked to their corresponding birth registration record. For the data years 2007 onwards, deaths that linked to their birth registration are then linked to birth notification data, enabling statistics by ethnicity of the baby. The linkage rate to both data sources is above 95% for all years except 2020, for which the linkage rate was 90.5%.

The survey is also a better indicator of long-term trends because it is unaffected by changes in levels of reporting to the police or police recording practices.\nThe <a href= 'https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hate-crime-statistics'> Hate Crime in England and Wales bulletin </a> publishes hate crime statistics based on both police recorded crime and the crime survey for England and Wales.

These population estimates do not yet take updated figures based on Census 2021 data into account. As a consequence, previous population estimates for 3 and 4-year-olds from 2013 onwards are likely overestimates to some extent, and therefore the derived take-up rates are likely underestimates. </p><p> For more information about both population estimates please see the \"About these statistics\" section within <a href=\"https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/education-provision-children-under-5\"> Education provision - children under 5 years of age</a>. </p><p> Population estimates are derived from mid-year estimates and projections produced by the ONS.

Imports are assigned to a product sector based on their 6 digit code, rather than the 8 digit code provided on the database. This is because at 8 digit level codes are frequently altered. Therefore, when mapping sectors using the most recently updated tariff schedule, import product codes from prior years will not be captured in instances where they have been updated. To overcome this, sectors are assigned to one 6 digit code only. Other caveats to consider - AVEs are calculated on the basis of trade between the UK and the EU between 2017-2018. This may not fully reflect the trading relationship between the UK and Developing nations, Least Developed nations and Small Island Developing Nations. To this end, the use of EU imports (as opposed to Rest of the World) could yield AVE inflationary effects, as EU imports are generally of higher quantity and higher price than imports from Rest of World. Where no trade has been recorded in 2017-18 between the UK-EU no AVE estimates have been derived for these goods in the sample. Additionally, missing values for both AVE rates and sectors arising from product code alterations affect the sample size. For AVEs, some of these missing values are overcome by 0% allocation where imports belong to regimes U10 (MFN Zero), U20 (GSP Zero) or U30 (Preference Zero). However, since such replacements cannot be made for non-zero tariff rate regimes, samples may contain disproportionate amounts of 0% rate tariffs, in turn, potentially yielding underestimating effects on average tariffs calculations.
