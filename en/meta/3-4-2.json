Due to the length of time it takes to complete a coroner's inquest, it can take months or even years for a suicide to be registered. 2) The large increase seen in Northern Ireland between 2004 and 2006 coincides with a change to the Coroners\u2019 Service. Prior to April 2006, there were seven Coroners\u2019 districts in Northern Ireland. Following a review of the Coroners\u2019 Service, the separate districts were amalgamated into one centralised Coroners\u2019 Service. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","page_content":"#### In **2018**\u2026 \n* There were 6,507 suicides registered in the UK, an age-standardised rate of 11.2 deaths per 100,000 population; the latest rate is significantly higher than that in 2017 and represents the first increase since 2013.\n* Three-quarters of registered deaths in 2018 were among men (4,903 deaths), which has been the case since the mid-1990s.\n* The UK male suicide rate of 17.2 deaths per 100,000 represents a significant increase from the rate in 2017; for females, the UK rate was 5.4 deaths per 100,000, consistent with the rates over the past 10 years. \n* Scotland had the highest suicide rate in GB with 16.1 deaths per 100,000 persons (784 deaths), followed by Wales with a rate of 12.8 per 100,000 (349 deaths) and England the lowest with 10.3 deaths per 100,000 (5,021 deaths).\n* Males aged 45 to 49 years had the highest age-specific suicide rate (27.1 deaths per 100,000 males); for females, the age group with the highest rate was also 45 to 49 years, at 9.2 deaths per 100,000.\n* Despite having a low number of deaths overall, rates among the under 25s have generally increased in recent years, particularly 10 to 24 year old females where the rate has increased significantly since 2012 to its highest level with 3.3 deaths per 100,000 females in 2018.\n\n#### See the [ONS 2018 report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2018registrations) for more information and a definition for suicide\n\nInformation on the [suicide prevention profile](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/suicide-prevention-profile) is available from Public Health England.
