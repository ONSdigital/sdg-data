People should use improved sanitation facilities which are not shared with other households, and the excreta produced should either be - <li>Treated and disposed in situ<li>Stored temporarily and then emptied and treated off-site<li>Transported through a sewer with wastewater and then treated off-site</li><p><p>If excreta from improved sanitation facilities are not safely managed, then people using those facilities are classed as having a basic sanitation service.
