This is the difference between output and intermediate consumption for any given industry/sector. This means the difference between the value of goods and services produced (output) and the cost of raw materials and other inputs which are used up in production (intermediate consumption). Data are in constant prices with 2016 defined as the base year.","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Energy Agency (IEA), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=9&Target=9.4","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 9.4","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Thousand Tonnes per Million GBP (\u00a3)","computation_calculations":"No calculations were used","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"2020 Carbon Dioxide emissions data are provisional","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"CO2 emissions intensity by industry","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"GDP","proxy":"proxy","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":1990,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalaccountsatmosphericemissionsgreenhousegasemissionsintensitybyeconomicsectorunitedkingdom","source_url_text_1":"Carbon dioxide emissions intensity by industry, 1990 to 2020","source_release_date_1":"09/06/2022","source_next_release_1":"TBA: We plan to update indicator data within 4 months of data being released","source_statistical_classification_1":"National statistic","source_contact_1":"Environment.Accounts@ons.gov.uk","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"09-04-01","other_info":"All emissions intensity figures exclude consumer expenditure. \"There are a number of changes to the intensity figures since the previous release.
