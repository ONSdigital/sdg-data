Publicly accessible functional green space is defined as a subset of functional green space, it removes green spaces expected to have restriction to entry, for example, golf courses. Restrictions to entry limits the ability of the green space to provide cultural services. Publicly accessible green space includes parks and public gardens, playing fields, cemetery and religious grounds.","computation_calculations":"Extent of publicly accessible green space (hectares)/extent of urban area (hectares)*100.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"Figures may not sum due to rounding.","graph_type":"bar","graph_title":"Publicly accessible green space as a proportion of urban area","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":"Public; Open Space; Habitat; Environment; Cities","expected_disaggregations":["Sex","Age","Persons with Disabilities"],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office For National Statistics, Ordnance Survey","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2019,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Great Britain","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/bulletins/uknaturalcapital/urbanaccounts#extent-of-green-and-blue-spaces-in-urban-areas-in-great-britain","source_url_text_1":"UK natural capital - Urban accounts - Table 3","source_release_date_1":"08/08/2019","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official Statistic","source_contact_1":"natural.capital.team@ons.gov.uk","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"11-07-01","other_info":"Estimates for the extent of green space in urban areas have been developed through collaborative work between the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Ordnance Survey (OS) .
