DMC per capita is calculated as DMC/UK population. DMC per GDP is calculated as DMC/GDP.","computation_calculations":"<p>No calculations were performed in the data acquisition for DMC and DMC per capita as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.</p><p>Domestic Material per GDP is calculated as DMC/GDP.</p>","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"1. Imports and exports for 'Other' and 'waste for final treatment and disposal' are included in the Domestic Material Consumption estimates. 2.
