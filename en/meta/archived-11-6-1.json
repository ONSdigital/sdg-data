The data reported here focus on the way waste collected by local authorities in England is managed (e.g landfill vs recycling). However, they do not capture the total waste in each local authority area as most commercial waste is not managed by local government. This information is not currently available at an individual local authority area level. We are exploring possible options to achieve this. \n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-04-08","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-04-08: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/d2e2ae9ffcd009625f62af4b5fa5ce012f610910","graph_limits":[{"unit":"Percentage (%)","minimum":0,"maximum":100}],"archive_type":"revised","permalink":"archived-indicators/11-6-1-archived","data_notice_class":"blank","data_notice_heading":"This is an <a href='https://sdgdata.gov.uk/archived-indicators'>archived</a> indicator","data_notice_text":"This indicator was revised following <a href='https://sdgdata.gov.uk/updates/2021/02/17/2020-indicator-changes.html'>indicator changes</a> from the United Nations 2020 Comprehensive Review.","indicator":"archived-11-6-1","target_id":"archived-11-6-1","sdg_goal":"archived-11-6-1"}
