It provides a standard and repeatable method for assessing the extinction risk status of thousands of animal, fungus and plant species.</p><p>Red List Index - The Red List Index value ranges from 1 (all species are categorised as \u2018Least Concern\u2019) to 0 (all species are categorised as \u2018Extinct\u2019), and so indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. A downward trend in the Red List Index over time means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. An upward Red List Index trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened species is on track. A Red List Index value of 1 would indicate that biodiversity loss has been halted.</p>","computation_calculations":"No calculations were performed in the data acquisition of this indicator as appropriate data was readily available in the final format specified by this indicator.

To avoid spurious results from biased selection of species, the Red List Index is calculated from taxonomic groups for which all species have been assessed and reassessed, and, for taxonomic groups that that do not fulfil this criteria, species that are representatively sampled. Changes between categories reflect geniune improvement or deterioration in status, not as a consequence of changes in taxonomy or knowledge.</p><p>The Red List Index is calculated on an annual basis, however, this does not reflect re-assessment of all species, as species are not assessed every year.
