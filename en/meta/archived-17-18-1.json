Based on this principle, a relevant disaggregation is most often defined as any classification that follows \"by\" in the title of the indicator, for example \"by age and sex\".  This working definition excludes cases where the title of the indicator includes sub-indicators, such as Indicator 2.5.2 - \"Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or at unknown level of risk of extinction\" \u2013 risk level is a sub-indicator rather than a disaggregation. Also, excluded are any references to the sample the indicator requires data for, such as Indicator 5.3.1 - \"Proportion of women aged 20-24 years who were married or in a union before age 15 and before age 18\" \u2013 sex and age are not disaggregations, but the sample required by the indicator.","computation_calculations":"Based on the definition above, across all goals 50 indicators were identified as containing specific disaggregations within the title. This number was used as the denominator for calculating the proportion of indicators with full disaggregation. The number of reported indicators on the UK SDG platform that fully achieve the disaggregation identified in their title are divided by the total number of indicators identified to contain disaggregation in their title (that is, 50). This number is then multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage of indicators with full disaggregation across all goals. The same process is followed for indicators that have available data only for some of the disaggregations identified in the title, in order to obtain percentage of indicators with achieved partial disaggregation. Likewise for indicators that require disaggregation in the title, but no data is available on the platform. In addition, a proxy variable counts towards achieving a required disaggregation. For example indicator 2.2.2 requires prevalence of malnutrition by type (wasting and overweight), which is achieved by using a classification by Body Mass Index (BMI) - obese, overweight, and underweight.\nWhen the data is additionally disaggregated by goal, the percentage represents the completeness of disaggregation (fully, partially, not disaggregated) based on the number of indicators identified to require disaggregation within that particular goal, rather than the total 50 indicators across all goals. Based on the outlined definition, Goals 6, 7 ,13, and 14 do not have any indicators that require disaggregation.","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"bar","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":null,"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2020,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"UK","source_url_1":"https://sdgdata.gov.uk/","source_url_text_1":"UK data for the Sustainable Development Goals","source_statistical_classification_1":"Experimental","source_contact_1":"SustainableDevelopment@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"All the data used for calculating the reported proportions is sourced from the indicators information available on the UK SDG platform","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"17-18-01","other_info":"The data reported here represents a snapshot from the end of the particular year.

Therefore, the methodology is slightly different and although the reported counts are the same, the percentage will differ.
