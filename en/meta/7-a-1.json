The flows covered by OOF are defined as all additional loans, grants and equity investments received by developing countries. These additional flows cover the same technologies and other activities (research and development, technical assistance, etc.) as listed in the CRS codes but exclude all flows extracted from the OECD/ CRS codes. The reported indicator only covers the ODA part, so it is likely an underestimation.","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=7&Target=7.a","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 7.a","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"GBP, USD at 2018 rate","computation_definitions":"<p>Official Development Assistance (ODA) - Resource flows to developing countries and multilateral organisations provided by official agencies (e.g. the UK Government) or their executive agencies.
