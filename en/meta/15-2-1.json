Northern Ireland and total UK figures for percentage of forest area with a long-term management plan, and forest area annual net change prior to 2013 are not shown here, as estimates before the change in methodology are not directly comparable to those after. Figures for calculating these are, however, available at <a href=\"https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/statistics-by-topic/woodland-statistics/\">Forest Research</a>.</p><p>The land area and forest area measurements used here are \u2018flat\u2019 as they do not take into account variations in relief e.g. mountains and valleys.</p><h3>Biomass stock</h3><p>Data for biomass stock are estimated using National Forest Inventory (NFI) estimates of 218 thousand oven dry tonnes for conifers, and 208 thousand oven dry tonnes for broadleaves in Great Britain (GB). It is assumed that the volume of deadwood per hectare is unchanged over time, and that all estimates per hectare for the UK are similar to GB levels. Growing stock estimates have been used to uprate GB biomass figures from the NFI report to UK figures and to derive a time series.</p><p>More information on biomass can be found in the Forestry Commission publication on <a href=\"https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/publications/biomass-in-live-woodland-trees-in-britain/\">Biomass in live woodland trees in Britain</a>.</p><h3>Protected areas</h3><p>For Great Britain, the woodland area within legally protected areas has been estimated by overlaying the National Forest Inventory woodland map with maps of designated areas. Geological Sites of Special Scientific Interest have been excluded from this analysis, as the designation in these cases is unlikely to be related to the presence of woodland. A similar analysis was undertaken by the Northern Ireland Forest Service for the Forest Resources Assessment 2015.</p><h3>Long-term management plans</h3><p>All Forestry England, Forestry and Land Scotland, Natural Resources Wales, and Forest Service woodland from 2000 is assumed to have a long-term management plan. For private sector woodland, the area of woodland with a long-term management plan has been estimated from data held in administrative systems for Grants & Regulations, or for areas of certified woodland (if this is larger). This is likely to undercount the true level of woodland with a long-term management plan.</p><h3>Independently verified management certification schemes</h3><p>Independently verified management certification schemes for the UK are the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) scheme and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) scheme. Many woodlands are certified under both. Certified woodland areas are often used as an indicator of sustainable forest management, however, woodland that is not certified may also be sustainably managed. Some choose not to become certified due to the cost involved and there may be little incentive for woodland owners to get their woodlands certified if timber production is not a major objective.</p><p>New certificates may relate to existing woodland that was not previously certified, or to newly planted areas.</p><h3>Further information</h3><p>For further information on the methodology and quality of woodland area estimates please see the <a href=\"https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/statistics-by-topic/woodland-statistics/\">Forest Research Woodland Statistics</a>.</p><p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.
