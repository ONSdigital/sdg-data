HPV vaccination for males in the UK started in September 2019. </p><p>In September 2014 the routine HPV programme was changed from a three to two-dose schedule. The recommendation was to offer the first (priming) HPV vaccine dose in Year 8 (aged 12 to 13 years) and the second dose in Year 9 (aged 13 to 14 years), previously all three doses had been offered in year 8. However, in some areas the second dose was scheduled within the same school year, from six months after the first dose. Consequently, for the first year of the two-dose programme (2014/15) national-level data are only available for the priming dose, and are therefore not included in the chart above. National coverage for the completed course of HPV vaccination for the first cohort offered the two-dose schedule was published in 2015/16.</p><p>All figures shown are rounded to 1 decimal place.</p><p>Please see the source data for caveats, full defintions, notes and figures to more decimal places.</p><p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.
