{"indicator_name":"Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels","target_name":"By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics","indicator_number":"14.4.1","csv_size":"22.058 kB","national_indicator_description":"The indicator comprises two broad measures \u2013 the percentage of fish stocks in seas around the UK that are i) harvested sustainably (series 1 to 3), and ii) at full reproductive capacity (series 4 to 6).    \n  \nMeasures are based on a group of 20 species in 57 stocks for which there are reliable estimates that allow the sustainability of the stocks to be evaluated. The indicator stocks include a range of local and widely distributed species of major importance to the UK fishing industry.  14% of the stocks within the dataset are interpreted to be straddling stocks (see Definitions field). Therefore these data do not fully follow UN specifications for this indicator.     \n  \nSeries on 'exploitation level' (series 1 to 3) give the percentage of stocks relative to the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Regarding sustainability, the aim is to increase the proportion of stocks fished at or below the fishing mortality target FMSY, and reduce to zero the number of stocks of unknown status relative to FMSY.     \n     \nSeries on 'biologically sustainable status' (series 4 to 6) show trends in the spawning stock biomass of stocks of UK interest with respect to safe biological limits. Safe biological limits are where the biomass is above the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY Btrigger). Regarding sustainability, the aim is to increase the proportion of stocks with SSB at or above MSY Btrigger and reduce to zero the number of stocks that have unknown status relative to MSY reference points.","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=14&Target=14.4","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 14.4","national_geographical_coverage":"United Kingdom","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","computation_definitions":"MSY - Maximum Sustainable Yield.  \n  \nFMSY - Maximum rate of fishing mortality (the proportion of a fish stock caught and removed by fishing) that will result (usually after a long period of time) in a population size  that enables a fish stock to deliver the maximum sustainable yield.  \n  \nMSY Btrigger - The biomass (body-weight of all fish) of a fish stock at which that stock can deliver Maximum Sustainable Yield.  \n  \nProportion of fish stocks that are not overexploited - The percentage of stocks fished at or below the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (FMSY).
