This score was calculated based on an assessment of the degree of adherence with, and implementation of, the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement and the 2009 FAO agreement on Port State measures. The calculation of this score also considered the development and implementation of the national action plan to combat IUU fishing, and the implementation of Flag State Responsibilities.\n\nThis assessment is based on the [UK\u2019s response](https://www.seafish.org/media/1685298/seafish_version_-_uk_fao_ccrf_aquaculture_questionnaire_2017_-_final.pdf) to questions within the [Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF)](http://www.fao.org/3/a-v9878e.pdf) survey.\n\nFor more information, see the [FAO indicator page](http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators/1461/en/).\n\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2020-07-03","national_data_updated_date":"2019-04-18","target_number":"14.6","goal_number":"14","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Degree of implementation of international instruments aiming to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing"}
