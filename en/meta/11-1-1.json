It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain. In this case a disabled household includes those that report any household member having a long-term illness or disability. </p>","available_disaggregations":"<p>All breakdowns are available for each level of Decent homes criteria</p><p>Geography - Select dwellings for geography breakdowns.
