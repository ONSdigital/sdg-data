It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain. In this case a disabled household includes those that report any household member having a long-term illness or disability. </p><p> 'HHSRS' refers to the housing health and safety rating system.<p/><p> Household income refers to the combined income and savings of the household reference person and any partner.<p/>","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"<p>1) Data that is not reported for any categories is due to small sample size resulting in unreliable estimates.<p/><p>2) The data are either for dwellings or households, which can be selected under units.
