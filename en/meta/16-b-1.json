There are five centrally monitored strands of hate crime - race or ethnicity; religion or beliefs; sexual orientation; disability; and transgender identity.</p><p>Disability Status - The <a href=\"https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/measuring-disability-for-the-equality-act-2010/\">(GSS) harmonised \"core\" definition</a> identifies a person as disabled if they have a physical or mental health condition or illness that has lasted or is expected to last 12 months or more. It must reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities. It is important to note that a person who has a long-term illness that does not reduce their ability to carry-out day-to-day activities is not disabled under the definition. The 'long-term health condition' category therefore includes both disabled and non-disabled people under this definition. The two sub-categories of non-disabled (GSS harmonised) are 'long-term health conditin - does not limit activities' and 'no long-term health condition'. The GSS harmonised questions are asked of the respondent in the survey, meaning that disability status is self-reported. The GSS definition is designed to reflect the definitions that appear in legal terms in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) for Northern Ireland and the 2010 Equality Act for Great Britain.</p>","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"Totals for hate crime might not be equal to the sum of incidents in the related equality strands as the victim may have said the crime was motivated by more than one strand.","graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Proportion of population who were victims of hate crime","data_show_map":true,"data_keywords":"Crime","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"2007/08 to 2008/09","source_geographical_coverage_1":"England and Wales","source_url_1":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/748508/hate-crime-1718-hosb2018-appendix-tables.ods","source_url_text_1":"Hate crime, England and Wales","source_release_date_1":"16/10/2018","source_next_release_1":"TBC","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"crimestatistics@ons.gov.uk","source_other_info_1":"Data acquired from the Crime Survey for England and Wales.","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator_sort_order":"16-bb-01","other_info":"<p>A reliable estimate for transgender-identity cannot be produced due to small numbers in the survey  and are therefore not reported.</p><p>For details of the Crime Survey for England and Wales, see the <a href= 'https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeandjusticemethodology'>user guide</a>  to crime statistics for England and Wales.</p><p>Ethnic group is based on the 2011 Census definition of ethnic group which now includes Chinese in the Asian/Asian British group.

Hate crime is also recorded by the police in England and Wales by police force area. The survey provides a better reflection of the extent of household and personal crime than police recorded statistics because the survey includes crimes that are not reported to, or recorded by, the police. The survey is also a better indicator of long-term trends because it is unaffected by changes in levels of reporting to the police or police recording practices.\nThe [Hate crime, England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hate-crime-england-and-wales-2017-to-2018) bulletin publishes hate crime statistics based on both police recorded crime and the crime survey for England and Wales.
