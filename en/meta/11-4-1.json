Expenditure data for 'Cultural heritage' has been extracted from annual expenditures of central and local government using UN Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) codes for 'Cultural services' GF0802.</p> 2. Data for government expenditure on 'Natural heritage' is based on public sector spending on UK biodiversity, therefore it only includes spending provided solely for the protection and promotion of biodiversity and generally excludes operational costs. It includes spending by central government and not that by local authorities.</p><p> 3. Figures for expenditure on biodiversity/natural heritage are presented as financial year data and for expenditure on cultural heritage are presented as calendar year data, as they are produced as such in the source publications. For example, data we present here for natural heritage in 2019, is data for the financial year ending March 2020 and has been combined with the mid-year population estimates for 2019 to calculate a per capita expenditure figure. The data we present here for cultural heritage in 2019 is for the calendar year 2019 and has been combined with the mid-year population estimates for 2019. </p><p> 4. Figures for UK public sector and NGO expenditure on biodiversity in the source publication are deflated using the UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator. Therefore, per capita expenditure figures presented in this indicator for Natural heritage are in constant (most recent year) prices and account for the effects of inflation.</p><p> 5. Given the large number of UK public sector organisations funding activities related to biodiversity and the complexities involved in both defining and identifying relevant expenditure, the figures presented in this indicator are likely to be an underestimation of total biodiversity spend by the UK public sector.</p><p> 6. The data reported for NGOs is collated predominantly from published annual accounts/financial reports. Almost all of the NGOs included in this data are registered as charities and detailed annual financial reports are published on the Charity Commission website. </p>","data_start_values":[{"field":"series","value":"Cultural heritage"},{"field":"Type of expenditure","value":"Central government expenditure"}],"graph_type":"line","graph_title":"Per capita expenditure on cultural and natural heritage","data_show_map":false,"data_keywords":null,"expected_disaggregations":["Source of funding (public, private)","Type of heritage","Level of government"],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":1995,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"United Kingdom","source_url_1":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicspending/datasets/esatable11annualexpenditureofcentralgovernment","source_url_text_1":"Annual Expenditure of Central Government","source_release_date_1":"22/02/2022","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"National Statistic","source_contact_1":"public.sector.inquiries@ons.gov.uk","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":1995,"source_geographical_coverage_2":"United Kingdom","source_url_2":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicspending/datasets/esatable11annualexpenditurelocalgovernment","source_url_text_2":"Annual Expenditure of Local Government","source_release_date_2":"22/02/2022","source_next_release_2":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_2":"National Statistic","source_contact_2":"public.sector.inquiries@ons.gov.uk","source_active_3":true,"source_organisation_3":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_3":"Annual","source_earliest_available_3":1995,"source_geographical_coverage_3":"United Kingdom","source_url_3":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicspending/datasets/esatable11annualexpenditureofgeneralgovernment","source_url_text_3":"Annual Expenditure of General Government","source_release_date_3":"22/02/2022","source_next_release_3":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_3":"National Statistic","source_contact_3":"public.sector.inquiries@ons.gov.uk","source_active_4":true,"source_organisation_4":"Office for National Statistics (ONS)","source_periodicity_4":"Annual","source_earliest_available_4":1971,"source_geographical_coverage_4":"United Kingdom","source_url_4":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/timeseries/ukpop/pop","source_url_text_4":"Mid-year population estimates - United Kingdom","source_release_date_4":"25/06/2021","source_next_release_4":"September 2022","source_statistical_classification_4":"Official Statistic","source_contact_4":"pop.info@ons.gov.uk","source_active_5":true,"source_organisation_5":"Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)","source_periodicity_5":"Annual","source_earliest_available_5":"2000/01","source_geographical_coverage_5":"United Kingdom","source_url_5":"https://hub.jncc.gov.uk/assets/42bca044-0e1b-449b-8e8f-e357e65e3822","source_url_text_5":"UK Biodiversity Indicators 2021.
