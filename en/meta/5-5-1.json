The House of Commons and House of Lords are representative of the entirety of the UK. In contrast, the data for local authority councillors are separated by country as are the devolved parliament and assembly seats of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \n\n\u2022\t Since 1918, when women were first permitted to stand as MPs, the UK has had a total of 491 elected female members to the House of Commons (up to end of August 2019).\n\n\u2022\t Until 1997 there had never been more than 10% of seats held by women. There are currently 225 female MPs in the House of Commons. At 35%, this is an all-time high. \n\n\u2022\t There are 229 female Members of the House of Lords, making up 28%.\n\n\u2022 Six ministers in the current Cabinet (27%) are women. The highest proportion of women in Cabinet was 36% between 2006 and 2007.\n\n\u2022 43% of Members of the Welsh Parliament are women, along with 45% of the Scottish Parliament and 36% of the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\nSee the <a href =\"https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN01250/SN01250.pdf\">House of Commons Library Briefing Paper</a> for more information.","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-03-09","national_data_updated_date":"2022-03-09","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-03-09: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/b1e02ce092f8615ddfbeb7674490db0f4091b142","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-03-09: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-data/commit/b974a2a72b7aee32ddb1a1676cd92008380ba617","graph_limits":[{"unit":"Percentage (%)","minimum":0,"maximum":100}],"indicator":"5.5.1","target_id":"5.5","sdg_goal":"5","graph_title":"Proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments and (b) local governments"}
