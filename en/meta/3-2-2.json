It is ONS practice not to calculate rates where there are fewer than 3 deaths in a cell, as rates based on such low numbers are susceptible to inaccurate interpretation. These values have been left blank and are flagged as 'Missing value; suppressed' in the observation status of the downloadable csv. Some figures shown have low reliability (rates based on between 3 and 19 deaths). This means that their reliability as a measure may be affected by the small number of events. Information on reliability is given in the observation status column in the downloadable csv. In particular, late neonatal figures have low reliability for some birthweights and some country of birth levels. See available disaggregations above for more information. </p><p>Breakdowns by birthweight, sex, mother's country of birth and age are only given where deaths could be linked to their corresponding birth registration record. For the data years 2007 onwards, deaths that linked to their birth registration are then linked to birth notification data, enabling statistics by ethnicity of the baby. The linkage rate to both data sources is above 95% for all years except 2020, for which the linkage rate was 90.5%.
