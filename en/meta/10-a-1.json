Proportion of Lines Imported Under 0% Tariff are calculated as the number of lines imported for a given sector under regimes U10 (MFN Zero), U20 (GSP Zero) or U30 (Preference Zero), divided by the total number of import lines for a given sector imported in the relevant year.

Imports are assigned to a product sector based on their 6 digit code, rather than the 8 digit code provided on the database. This is because at 8 digit level codes are frequently altered. Therefore, when mapping sectors using the most recently updated tariff schedule, import product codes from prior years will not be captured in instances where they have been updated. To overcome this, sectors are assigned to one 6 digit code only. Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.","page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-03-04","national_data_updated_date":"2022-03-04","graph_limits":[{"unit":"Percentage (%)","minimum":0,"maximum":100}],"target_number":"10.a","goal_number":"10","graph_title":"Proportion of tariff lines applied to imports from least developed countries and developing countries with zero-tariff"}
