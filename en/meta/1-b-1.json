Therefore, the figures may be different to those published elsewhere and are likely to be less than the actual proportion of government spending on the monetary poor. Furthermore, data on incomes at the very top and bottom of the distribution are less reliable, therefore, \u2018monetary poor\u2019 may sometimes include people who\u2019s incomes are volatile and may not actually be considered to be \u2018monetary poor\u2019. </p> <p> Data on education and the NHS are modelled to predict the amount households receive. For certain aspects of spending on education and the NHS, the models predict how much spending goes towards specific age groups, different genders and different regions, so the demographic information of the survey respondents is used to allocate government spending across the population. </p> Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.
