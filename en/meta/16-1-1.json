While in the vast majority of cases the offence will be recorded in the same year as it took place, this is not always the case. Caution is therefore needed when looking at longer-term homicide trends.","computation_calculations":"Rate per 100,000 = (Rate per 1,000,000 population/10)","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":"1.
