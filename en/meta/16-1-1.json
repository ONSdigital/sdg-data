The Homicide Index data are based on the year when the offence was recorded as a crime, not when the offence took place or when the case was heard in court. While in the vast majority of cases the offence will be recorded in the same year as it took place, this is not always the case. Caution is therefore needed when looking at longer-term homicide trends. </p><p> The Homicide Index is continually updated with revised information from the police as investigations continue and as cases are heard by the courts.
